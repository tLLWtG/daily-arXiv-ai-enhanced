TL;DR: 该论文开发了一个分析框架来研究AI系统的递归自我改进，通过物理和信息论限制定义服务边界，建立内生增长模型来区分超线性和次临界状态，并提供可测试的失控增长条件和实际安全控制措施。

Result: 推导出将可观察序列映射为失控与非奇异行为证书的决策规则，提供基于改进加速速度的可证伪测试，以及功率限制、吞吐量节流和评估门等可直接实施的安全控制。

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型的数据归因方法计算资源消耗大，难以在实际应用中部署，需要开发高效的归因方法。

Method: 将基于反学习的慢速归因方法蒸馏到特征嵌入空间，结合高效索引和搜索方法，无需运行昂贵的归因算法即可找到高影响力训练图像。

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了首个基于共识的视频评估工具ColoWorkflow，用于微创结直肠手术的工作流程分析，建立了可重复的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微创结直肠手术存在程序变异性大、学习曲线陡峭和并发症影响质量的问题，需要数据驱动的工具来减少变异性、优化培训和改善手术表现。

Method: 通过德尔菲法达成关于通用工作流程描述符的共识，开发ColoWorkflow工具，并在多中心视频数据集上由独立评分者应用该工具，评估适用性和评分者间可靠性。

Result: 达成了10个程序无关阶段和34个程序特定步骤的共识，工具在54个手术视频中表现出广泛适用性，评分者间可靠性中等（阶段K=0.71，步骤K=0.66）。

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow是首个基于共识的验证工具，为微创结直肠手术建立了可重复的工作流程分析框架，支持跨机构基准测试和AI驱动的工作流程识别发展。

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin提出了一种新颖的相位窗口搜索算法，用于对象级基础模型的忠实区域归因，以近线性复杂度实现了接近贪婪选择的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于子模子集选择的方法虽然忠实度高，但计算效率低，限制了在实际场景中的部署应用。

Method: 采用分阶段粗到细搜索策略，结合自适应剪枝、窗口化细粒度选择和动态监督机制，替代传统的二次成本贪婪选择。

Result: PhaseWin仅使用20%的计算预算就能达到贪婪归因95%以上的忠实度，在目标检测和视觉定位任务中均优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: PhaseWin为对象级多模态模型建立了可扩展、高忠实度归因的新技术标准。

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种正负提示监督方法，通过优化正负提示来增强基于能量的OOD检测性能。正提示关注类内特征，负提示聚焦类别边界特征，并通过图架构将语义监督传播到视觉分支。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于视觉语言模型的OOD检测方法使用负提示来强调图像特征与提示内容之间的差异，但这些提示往往包含广泛的非ID特征，可能捕获重叠或误导性信息，导致次优结果。

Method: 1. 使用大语言模型初始化类特定的正负提示；2. 优化提示，正提示关注类内特征，负提示突出类别边界特征；3. 采用基于图的架构聚合优化提示表示的语义感知监督，并传播到视觉分支。

Conclusion: 所提出的正负提示监督方法通过优化提示表示并利用图架构传播语义监督，有效提升了基于能量的OOD检测器的性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n两个轻量级模型在面部表情识别中的表现，发现YOLOv12n在干净数据集上表现更好，而YOLOv11n在噪声环境下具有更高的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非约束性真实环境中，面部表情识别仍然具有挑战性，需要平衡性能与效率的轻量级模型。

Method: 将FER2013和KDEF两个基准分类数据集转换为目标检测格式，使用YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n模型进行评估，采用mAP 0.5、精度、召回率和混淆矩阵等指标。

Result: YOLOv12n在干净的KDEF数据集上获得95.6的mAP 0.5最高性能，在FER2013数据集上mAP为63.8；YOLOv11n在FER2013上精度达65.2，误报更少。

Conclusion: 轻量级YOLO模型能有效平衡性能与效率，在敏感性和精度之间存在权衡，适合实时、资源受限的情感感知AI应用。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

### [10] [Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10942)
*Liuchi Xu,Hao Zheng,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为异构互补蒸馏（HCD）的新方法，用于解决异构架构（如ViT到ResNet18）知识蒸馏中的特征表示差异问题。该方法通过整合教师和学生的互补特征，在共享logits中对齐表示，并引入子logit解耦蒸馏和正交性损失来促进多样化知识转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构架构知识蒸馏面临空间特征表示差异的挑战，传统KD方法主要针对同构架构设计，而现有异构KD方法存在计算成本高、设计复杂或过度依赖logit对齐等问题，无法充分利用互补特征。

Method: 提出HCD框架：通过卷积投影器和自适应池化处理学生中间特征，与教师倒数第二层特征拼接，通过互补特征映射器（CFM）生成共享logits；引入子logit解耦蒸馏（SDD）将共享logits划分为n个子logits，与教师logits融合以修正分类；使用正交性损失（OL）确保子logit多样性并减少冗余知识转移。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、细粒度数据集（如CUB200）和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验表明，HCD优于最先进的KD方法。

Conclusion: HCD通过保留学生特定优势并利用教师知识，增强了学生的鲁棒性和泛化能力，是异构知识蒸馏的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法表现出显著的性能优势。

Conclusion: FedBCS通过领域不变上下文原型对齐有效解决了联邦学习中的特征异质性问题，提升了医学图像分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DEFT-LLM方法，通过多专家解耦实现运动语义对齐，解决微表情识别中静态外观与动态运动线索纠缠以及文本标签与面部肌肉运动语义差距的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别对于推断真实情绪至关重要。现有方法存在两个核心挑战：(1)静态外观和动态运动线索的纠缠阻碍模型关注细微运动；(2)现有数据集的文本标签与面部肌肉运动不完全对应，造成文本监督与物理运动之间的语义差距。

Method: 提出DEFT-LLM方法，包含：1)构建Uni-MER运动驱动指令数据集，利用光流和动作单元(AU)标签的双重约束确保时空一致性和运动对应；2)设计三专家架构，将面部动态解耦为独立可解释的表征（结构、动态纹理和运动语义）；3)将指令对齐知识整合到模型中，注入有效的物理先验。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的微表情识别基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并在局部面部运动的可解释建模方面具有特别优势。

Conclusion: DEFT-LLM通过多专家解耦和运动语义对齐，能够精确捕捉细微情绪线索，同时利用大语言模型的跨模态推理能力，为微表情识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

TL;DR: ERMoE是一种稀疏MoE架构，通过重新参数化专家到学习正交特征基，并用特征基得分替代学习门控逻辑，解决了路由不稳定和专家利用不足的问题，无需显式负载平衡损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE架构中路由器逻辑与专家内部结构不对齐导致的路由不稳定、专家利用不足，以及负载不平衡造成的瓶颈问题。

Method: 将每个专家重新参数化到学习的正交特征基中，用输入特征与专家基之间的余弦相似度（特征基得分）替代学习门控逻辑，实现内容感知路由。

Conclusion: ERMoE为稀疏专家模型引入了新的架构原则，直接解决路由不稳定性，实现可扩展、可解释的专业化，同时提升性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

TL;DR: DMC是一个用于CLIP模型类增量学习的两阶段框架，通过解耦视觉编码器和文本软提示的优化来解决分类器偏差问题。DMC-OT是其增强版本，引入最优传输校准策略来对齐记忆统计信息。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的CLIP模型在持续学习场景中面临挑战，特别是学习新类别的任务特定软提示会导致严重的分类器偏差，因为文本原型在没有先前数据的情况下会过度拟合到最近的类别。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、Imagenet-R、CUB-200和UCF-101上的广泛实验表明，DMC和DMC-OT都实现了最先进的性能，DMC-OT进一步将准确率平均提高了1.80%。

Conclusion: DMC框架通过解耦视觉和文本模态的优化，有效解决了CLIP模型在类增量学习中的分类器偏差问题，DMC-OT的校准策略进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

*Bowen Sun,Yujun Cai,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Hang Wu,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)方法，通过应用小相位偏移并聚合输出来解决视频LLMs中的时间不一致性问题，无需训练即可提升时间编码的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频LLMs存在时间不一致性问题：帧时序的微小变化会翻转注意力并抑制相关帧。这种不稳定性源于将Rotary Position Embeddings扩展到视频时产生的逆傅里叶时间核，其帧级波动会扰动注意力机制。

Method: 提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)方法：在多个头之间应用小的相反相位偏移，然后聚合它们的输出。该方法保持每个头的频谱幅度，同时通过聚合有效平滑时间核并减少相位敏感性，无需改变位置编码结构。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，在匹配token预算下显示出持续改进，计算开销可忽略不计。分析表明PAS能够平滑时间核，使注意力对小时间偏移具有Lipschitz稳定性。

Conclusion: PAS为视频LLMs提供了一个即插即用的升级方案，用于实现鲁棒的时间编码，通过多相位平均衰减高频波动同时保持每个头的频谱特性。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的二值验证工作流程，用于零样本视觉任务。该方法通过量化和二值化两个步骤，将开放性问题转换为多项选择题和真/假验证问题，显著提升现有视觉语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在零样本视觉任务中表现不佳，特别是处理开放式查询时。作者希望通过推理时设计而非任务特定训练来提升模型性能。

Method: 工作流程包含两个步骤：(1) 量化：将开放式查询转换为具有明确候选答案的多项选择题；(2) 二值化：为每个候选答案提出真/假问题，并通过确定性逻辑进行解析。

Result: 在指代表达式定位、空间推理和BLINK-Jigsaw等任务上，该方法相比直接回答开放式查询有显著提升。量化到多项选择题带来大幅增益，真/假二值化提供一致额外提升。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单统一的推理时工作流程，强调推理时设计而非任务特定训练，为现有视觉语言模型提供了实用的零样本视觉性能提升路径。

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视自回归模型在无损图像压缩中的应用，通过分层并行化和渐进适应策略，使纯自回归模型成为实用且性能领先的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型虽然是无损图像压缩的理论性能基准，但由于计算成本过高通常被认为不实用。本文旨在重新思考这一范式，建立实用且高性能的自回归压缩框架。

Method: 提出HPAC模型，采用分层分解结构和内容感知卷积门控；引入CSI推理优化消除冗余计算；AFC扩展支持高比特深度图像；SARP-FT渐进微调策略基于信息密度选择区域优化低秩适配器。

Result: 在多种数据集（自然、卫星、医学图像）上的实验验证了该方法实现了新的最先进压缩性能，在保持小参数数量和竞争性编码速度的同时显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的自回归框架能够在无损图像压缩中提供显著性能提升，重新确立了自回归模型作为实用高性能解决方案的地位。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, the theoretical performance benchmark for learned lossless image compression, are often dismissed as impractical due to prohibitive computational cost. This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression. Notably, our approach sets a new benchmark in learned lossless compression, showing a carefully designed AR framework can offer significant gains over existing methods with a small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLUE是一个生成模型框架，基于Stable Diffusion架构，通过固定格式提示实现多样化生成并保持稳定性，无需额外数据。在医学领域（中耳炎数据集）表现出色，显著改善图像质量和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像合成模型在专业领域（如医学）面临的挑战，这些领域数据种类有限且数量不足，现有方法难以实现多样化生成同时保持稳定性。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion架构，引入Style Encoder处理图像和提示生成风格嵌入，通过新的第二注意力层集成到U-Net中，使用KL散度在潜在空间中实现图像特征的连续高斯分布表示。

Result: 在中耳炎数据集上，FID从46.81降至9.30，召回率从49.60%提升至70.29%。仅使用合成数据训练的分类器F1分数达83.21%，合成与真实数据结合时F1分数达94.76%。在外部数据集上同样表现优异。

Conclusion: CLUE能够在有限数据集上实现多样化且稳定的图像生成，是领域特定应用的有效数据增强方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多模态数据常常存在模态缺失问题，现有方法通过简单生成方式处理但无法保持跨模态一致性，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出PROMISE框架，将多模态提示学习融入层次对比学习，配备专门设计的提示注意力机制，动态生成缺失模态下的鲁棒表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验和消融研究表明，PROMISE相比现有最先进多模态方法表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: PROMISE通过创新的提示注意力层次对比学习框架，有效解决了模态缺失场景下的跨模态表示一致性问题。

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成系统主要关注低层次视觉指标而忽视情感维度，视频领域缺乏专门资源来连接情感理解与生成任务，特别是在风格化和非现实情境下。

Method: 引入EmoVid数据集，包含情感标签、视觉属性和文本标注；通过系统分析揭示视觉特征与情感感知的时空模式；基于这些洞察开发情感条件视频生成技术，对Wan2.1模型进行微调。

Result: 在文本到视频和图像到视频任务中，生成视频的定量指标和视觉质量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: EmoVid为情感视频计算设立了新基准，不仅为艺术风格视频的视觉情感分析提供了宝贵见解，还为增强视频生成中的情感表达提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型过度依赖语言先验而非视觉证据，导致产生未基于视觉信息的幻觉响应，缺乏量化衡量模型在推理过程中实际使用视觉信息的方法。

Method: DnR框架包含问题条件化的相关性映射来定位问题特定线索，通过相关性引导的概率掩码测量依赖度，并利用外部视觉专家输出（如边界框或掩码）作为视觉线索，重新查询模型选择利用率提升最大的响应。

Conclusion: 测量视觉利用率为构建更可解释和基于证据的多模态智能体系统提供了原则性路径，无需重新训练或架构改变即可增强视觉基础。

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

Method: 基于人类认知记忆理论，提出VisMem框架，包含短期视觉主导记忆模块用于细粒度感知保留，和长期语义主导记忆模块用于抽象语义整合，这些记忆在推理过程中被动态调用。

Result: 在多个视觉理解、推理和生成基准测试中，VisMem相比原始模型平均性能提升11.8%，优于所有对比方法。

Conclusion: VisMem建立了一种新的潜在空间记忆增强范式，能够同时保持感知保真度和语义一致性，显著提升视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement.

Motivation: 现有推理时引导方法缺乏自适应性和选择性，无法根据提示词调整引导强度，也无法仅针对图像的不安全区域进行引导，导致安全防护效果有限。

Method: 通过估计提示词危害性，应用选择性引导掩码来仅引导图像中的不安全区域，实现自适应和选择性的安全防护。

Result: 实验表明SP-Guard比现有方法生成更安全的图像，同时最大限度地减少对内容的意外修改。

Conclusion: 除了提高安全性外，研究还强调了图像生成中透明度和可控性的重要性。

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

Conclusion: AirCopBench填补了多智能体协作感知评估的空白，揭示了MLLM在复杂协作场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

TL;DR: EmbryoDiff是一个基于扩散模型的两阶段框架，用于体外受精胚胎发育阶段的精细识别，通过多焦点特征融合和混合语义边界条件实现准确分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有判别模型未能利用胚胎发育的分布先验来提高准确性，且依赖单焦点信息导致胚胎表示不完整，容易在细胞遮挡下产生特征模糊。

Method: 提出两阶段扩散框架：首先训练冻结的帧级编码器提取多焦点特征；然后引入多焦点特征融合策略构建3D感知形态表示；设计混合语义边界条件块注入扩散去噪过程。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上达到最先进结果，仅需单次去噪步骤即可获得82.8%和81.3%的平均测试准确率。

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff通过扩散模型和多焦点特征融合有效解决了胚胎发育阶段识别中的特征模糊问题，显著提升了分类准确性。

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合粒度缓存方法HGC，通过在不同计算阶段采用不同粒度的缓存策略来降低可控生成模型的计算开销，显著提升生成效率同时保持视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可控生成模型在处理控制条件和内容生成时的计算需求大、生成效率低的问题。

Method: 采用混合粒度缓存策略：1）粗粒度缓存（块级）基于特征重用在编码器-解码器块间动态绕过冗余计算；2）细粒度缓存（提示级）在模块内重用跨注意力图并扩展到相邻步骤的相应模块计算。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证有效性，在COCO-Stuff分割基准上显著降低计算成本63%（从18.22T到6.70T MACs），同时语义保真度损失控制在1.5%以内。

Conclusion: HGC方法在平衡生成效率和视觉质量方面具有优势，能够显著降低计算开销同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossMed是一个评估医学多模态大语言模型组合泛化能力的基准，使用模态-解剖-任务(MAT)框架，将四个公共数据集统一为视觉问答格式，包含20,200个多项选择题实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在医学AI中应用前景广阔，但其在未见过的成像模态、解剖结构和任务类型组合上的泛化能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用MAT框架将CheXpert、SIIM-ACR、BraTS 2020和MosMedData四个数据集重新格式化为统一的视觉问答格式，评估LLaVA-Vicuna-7B和Qwen2-VL-7B模型在相关、不相关和零重叠MAT分割上的表现。

Result: 在相关分割上模型达到83.2%的分类准确率和0.75的分割cIoU，但在不相关和零重叠条件下性能显著下降。跨任务迁移显示仅使用分类数据训练时分割性能提升7% cIoU。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在组合泛化方面表现独特优势，CrossMed为评估医学视觉语言模型的零样本、跨任务和模态无关泛化提供了严格测试平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

Motivation: 现有生成式图像合成方法在同时保持细节和调整前景姿态/视角方面仍存在困难，需要解决这一关键问题。

Method: 将现有生成式合成模型扩展到多参考版本，允许使用任意数量的前景参考图像，并校准参考图像的全局和局部特征以与背景信息兼容。

Result: 在MVImgNet和MureCom数据集上的大量实验表明，生成模型能从校准的参考特征中显著受益。

Conclusion: 通过多参考图像和特征校准，生成式图像合成模型能够更好地同时实现细节保持和前景姿态/视角调整。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

TL;DR: LiteAttention利用扩散注意力中的时间相干性特性，通过早期标记非必要tile并向前传播跳过决策，在保持视频生成质量的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散变换器加速方法面临基本权衡：动态估计稀疏注意力模式会产生高计算开销和估计误差，而静态稀疏模式在整个去噪过程中保持固定且通常次优。

Method: 识别扩散注意力的时间相干性特性，引入LiteAttention方法，利用时间相干性在去噪序列中实现进化计算跳过，通过早期标记非必要tile并传播跳过决策来消除冗余注意力计算。

Result: 在FlashAttention基础上实现高度优化的LiteAttention内核，在生成视频扩散模型上实现显著加速，且无质量下降。

Conclusion: LiteAttention结合了动态方法的适应性和静态方法的效率，为扩散变换器提供了一种有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 采用浅到深策略：从粗粒度放射图像-报告配对开始，引入参考报告进行实例级指导，最后使用关键短语在特定解剖细节上建立基础。通过基于记忆的适配器实现特征共享。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU X-Ray基准测试中达到最先进性能，消融研究验证了多阶段辅助引导方法的有效性。

Conclusion: S2D-Align为增强复杂多模态生成任务中的基础能力提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种生成模型（去噪扩散概率模型和自回归因果变换器）在3D形状生成和补全任务中的表现，发现扩散模型在连续潜在空间中表现最佳，而自回归模型在相同离散潜在空间中也能达到或超过扩散模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然生成模型在包括3D数据在内的多种数据模态中得到了广泛应用，但对于哪种模型最适合特定任务尚未达成共识。此外，文本和图像等条件信息常用于引导生成过程，但部分3D数据等条件信息尚未得到充分评估。

Method: 比较了两种有前景的生成模型——去噪扩散概率模型和自回归因果变换器，将它们适配用于生成形状建模和补全任务。进行了全面的定量评估和比较，包括基线判别模型和广泛的消融研究。

Result: 结果显示：（1）具有连续潜在空间的扩散模型在从单个噪声深度图像进行多模态形状补全的任务中，优于判别模型和自回归方法，并在现实条件下实现了最先进的性能；（2）在相同的离散潜在空间中比较时，自回归模型能够匹配或超过扩散模型在这些任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在连续潜在空间中表现最优，而自回归模型在离散潜在空间中具有竞争力，两种模型在不同条件下都能在3D形状生成和补全任务中取得良好效果。

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD)框架和Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO)方法，旨在激发多模态大语言模型中的内部知识推理能力，解决KBVQA任务中推理过程不明确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KBVQA方法要么通过上下文学习利用多模态大语言模型中的隐式知识，要么通过检索增强生成利用显式知识，但它们的推理过程仍然不明确，缺乏从MLLMs中获得的明确多步轨迹。

Method: 首先通过提示冻结的7B规模MLLM完成问题与其真实答案之间的推理过程，构建Hindsight-Zero训练数据；然后将Hindsight-Zero自蒸馏为思维链生成器和知识生成器；最后通过KEPO优化知识生成器，偏好低置信度但有用的知识。

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上的实验验证了HinD的有效性，显示使用7B规模MLLM激发推理的HinD在不使用商业模型API或外部知识的情况下实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: HinD框架成功激发了MLLMs的内部知识推理能力，为KBVQA任务提供了一种有效的推理增强方法。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

Conclusion: 混响变换作为一种通用的延迟建模方法具有潜力，能够实现可控的轨迹预测并提高系统的因果连续性。

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

TL;DR: MultiTypeFCDD是一个轻量级卷积框架，用于可解释的多类型异常检测，无需为每个对象类别训练单独模型，在计算资源受限的实际应用中具有实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释异常检测方法无法区分异常类型，且需要为每个对象类别训练和维护单独模型，缺乏特异性。大型视觉语言模型虽然能解决此问题但计算密集，不适用于实时或嵌入式系统。

Method: 提出MultiTypeFCDD框架，仅使用图像级标签学习并生成多通道热图，每个通道对应特定异常类型。作为统一框架，能够跨多个对象类别区分异常类型。

Result: 在Real-IAD数据集上评估，该方法在显著减少参数负载和推理时间的同时，取得了与最先进复杂模型竞争的结果。

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD是一个高度实用且可行的解决方案，特别适用于计算资源严格受限的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

Motivation: 现实世界中多视角视频常因相机触发延迟或独立录制设置导致时序不同步，而现有4D高斯溅射方法假设输入视频流是时序同步的，这限制了其在真实场景中的应用。

Method: 采用粗到精的对齐模块，先确定粗略的帧级偏移，然后细化为亚帧精度，该策略可作为即插即用模块集成到现有4DGS框架中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效处理时序错位视频，并显著提升基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的时序对齐策略增强了4DGS框架处理异步数据的鲁棒性，实现了高质量的非同步多视角视频重建。

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Conclusion: Viper-F1通过状态空间模型和视觉定位增强，在保持高效推理的同时解决了多模态模型在细粒度理解方面的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: This paper is a submission for the Weather4Cast~2025 complementary Pollution Task and presents an efficient framework for 6-hour lead-time nowcasting of PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型取得了显著进展，但其在保持语义不变的小规模输入变化下的可靠性仍未得到充分理解，需要系统评估模型对良性扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过像素级偏移、轻微几何变换、填充缩放、改写和多语言重写等不改变语义的扰动方式，在多种模型和数据集上进行大规模系统性测试。

Result: 现代VLM对微小扰动高度敏感，即使是GPT-4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash等最先进系统也经常在几像素偏移或无害改写下失效；样本稳定性与正确性高度相关。

Conclusion: 当前VLM存在根本性脆弱性，需要超越对抗性扰动的鲁棒性评估，重点关注模型应可靠保持的不变性；小模型稳定性模式可预测大模型正确性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Conclusion: GSD框架有效解决了3D高斯溅射在稀疏视图下的过拟合问题，通过视频扩散模型的多视角一致性先验实现了更好的3D场景表示。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

### [55] [Positional Bias in Multimodal Embedding Models: Do They Favor the Beginning, the Middle, or the End?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11216)
*Kebin Wu,Fatima Albreiki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态表示模型中的位置偏见问题，特别是在图像-文本检索任务中，发现文本编码器倾向于输入开头，而图像编码器在开头和结尾都表现出偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然文本生成模型中的位置偏见已被广泛研究，但在表示模型特别是多模态模型中的位置偏见及其影响仍未被充分探索。

Method: 通过区分上下文重要性和位置偏见，评估不同模型和数据集中的位置偏见存在程度和表现形式。

Result: 实验表明位置偏见在多模态模型中普遍存在，但不同模态表现不同：文本编码器偏向输入开头，图像编码器在开头和结尾都表现出偏见。这种偏见源于位置编码方案、训练损失、上下文重要性以及多模态训练中图像-文本对的使用方式。

Conclusion: 多模态表示模型中存在显著的位置偏见，且在不同模态中表现不同，这对模型性能产生负面影响，需要进一步研究和缓解。

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

*Mingwei Xing,Xinliang Wang,Yifeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoReMi是一个混合专家框架，通过联合建模领域感知专家分支和统一表示分支，解决多源点云数据异构性导致的负迁移问题，在多个3D理解基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D深度学习在多领域泛化能力有限，主要由于数据集规模小和多源点云的高度异构性。不同传感器采集的点云在密度和噪声分布上存在显著差异，导致多领域融合时出现负迁移。现有方法要么只关注领域感知特征，要么只关注领域通用特征，忽略了二者之间的协同潜力。

Method: 提出DoReMi（Domain-Representation Mixture）框架，采用混合专家（MoE）架构，包含领域感知专家分支和统一表示分支。通过领域引导空间路由（DSR）动态激活领域感知专家分支，使用熵控制动态分配（EDA）实现稳定高效的专家利用。统一表示分支通过鲁棒的多属性自监督学习预训练并保持冻结状态。

Result: 在多个3D理解基准测试中评估DoReMi，在ScanNet Val上达到80.1% mIoU，在S3DIS上达到77.2% mIoU，表现出与现有方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: DoReMi通过协同学习专业化和可泛化知识，有效建模多样化领域分布，同时保持跨领域几何和结构先验，展示了作为未来3D理解研究基础框架的强大潜力。

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 通用图像编辑模型在面对新风格时往往无法产生令人满意的结果，如何仅使用有限数量的配对数据有效微调通用图像编辑模型以适应新风格是一个挑战。

Method: 提出参数高效的多风格MoE LoRA方法，包含风格特定和风格共享路由机制；通过新的度量引导方法自动确定每层的最佳秩；探索在DiT模型中插入LoRA的最佳位置；整合对抗学习和流匹配来指导扩散训练过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在显著减少LoRA参数的情况下，优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的MoE LoRA结构和训练策略，成功解决了小样本风格编辑问题，在参数效率和性能方面都表现出色。

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

TL;DR: AUVIC是一个针对多模态大语言模型的视觉概念遗忘框架，通过对抗性扰动实现精确的目标概念移除，同时避免对相关实体的性能影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型训练数据包含敏感或受版权保护内容，需要满足'被遗忘权'的监管要求，但视觉概念遗忘在MLLMs中研究不足。

Method: 引入AUVIC框架，应用对抗性扰动实现精确的视觉概念遗忘，有效隔离目标概念而不影响相似实体。

Result: 实验结果表明AUVIC实现了最先进的目标遗忘率，同时对非目标概念的性能影响最小。

Conclusion: AUVIC为MLLMs中的视觉概念遗忘提供了有效解决方案，构建了首个评估基准VCUBench，验证了方法的优越性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEODE模型通过解耦3D推理和数值生成，解决了现有视觉语言模型在3D空间理解上的双重瓶颈问题，使用专门的模块实现空间推理和精确回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在理解真实世界3D空间智能方面存在根本性困难，主要源于输入阶段的几何感知编码器与2D特征冲突，以及输出阶段的离散分词器无法生成精确连续数值的双重瓶颈。

Method: 引入GEODE架构，包含两个即插即用模块：解耦推理模块（DRM）作为空间协处理器，通过交叉注意力对齐3D数据和2D视觉特征；直接回归头（DRH）采用"嵌入即值"范式，通过轻量级MLP实现精确连续回归。

Result: 1.5B参数的GEODE模型实现了最先进的空间推理性能，可与7B+模型相媲美，作为高级语义调度器发挥作用。

Conclusion: GEODE通过解耦3D推理和数值生成的双模块设计，有效突破了现有视觉语言模型在3D空间理解上的瓶颈，为几何感知视觉语言模型提供了新的架构思路。

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本到图像扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊性，提出了多模态标志性概念，开发了区分文化参考识别与实现的评估框架，并发现模型在文本提示变化时仍能复制标志性视觉结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊性，特别关注多模态标志性现象，即图像和文本唤起文化共享关联的情况。

Method: 引入评估框架分离识别（模型是否识别参考）与实现（如何通过复制或重新诠释来描绘），评估五个扩散模型在767个维基数据文化参考上的表现，并进行提示扰动实验。

Result: 框架比现有基于相似性的方法更有效地区分复制与转换；模型在文本提示改变时仍经常复制标志性视觉结构；文化对齐不仅与训练数据频率相关，还与文本独特性、参考流行度和创建日期相关。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的价值不仅在于复制内容，更在于如何转换和重新语境化文化知识，推动评估超越简单的文本-图像匹配，实现更丰富的语境理解。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountSteer是一种无需训练的方法，通过引导扩散模型的交叉注意力隐藏状态来改进文本到图像生成中的对象计数准确性，在保持视觉质量的同时将计数准确率提高了约4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成逼真连贯的图像，但往往无法遵循文本中的数值指令，这揭示了语言和视觉表示之间的差距。研究发现这些模型并非完全对数字无感知，它们隐式地知道自己的计数准确性，内部信号会根据输出是否满足指定计数而一致变化。

Method: 基于模型已编码潜在数值正确性概念的直觉，引入CountSteer方法，在推理过程中引导模型的交叉注意力隐藏状态，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验表明，CountSteer将对象计数准确率提高了约4%，同时不损害视觉质量。

Conclusion: CountSteer展示了向更可控和语义可靠的文本到图像生成迈出的简单而有效的步骤，通过利用模型内在的数值感知能力来改进生成精度。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过分组caption tokens来获取细粒度视觉语言表示的方法，将语言表示与图像中的对象对齐，从而提升视觉语言模型的细粒度理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型主要关注图像块与语言token的对齐，但图像块对人类无意义，单个token也不一定携带可接地的图像信息。需要将token分组来描述场景的不同方面，以获得更好的细粒度知识理解。

Method: 提出一种在架构中分组caption tokens的模型，学习将token分组以获得细粒度语言表示，并将这些表示与经过训练发现对象的图像编码器输出对齐。

Result: 通过学习token分组，视觉语言模型在视觉和语言理解方面表现出更好的细粒度能力。模型发现的token组与文本中的可接地短语在定性和定量上都高度相似。

Conclusion: 通过token分组方法可以有效提升视觉语言模型的细粒度理解能力，模型能够自动发现与图像中对象相对应的语言短语结构。

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在自动驾驶规划中缺乏对空间结构和动态交互关系的显式监督，限制了它们从原始传感器数据中推断交通实体间相互影响的能力。

Method: 开发了一种模型无关的方法，将不同抽象层次和格式的场景图序列化，并通过结构化提示模板将其整合到模型中，系统分析关系监督的效益。

Conclusion: 即使测试时不需要场景图输入，模型也能通过场景图条件化训练更好地内化和基础化关系先验知识。

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

Method: 引入Prelim Attention Score (PAS)，基于对prelim标记的注意力权重计算轻量级信号，无需额外前向传播，可在推理过程中实时计算。

Result: PAS在多个模型和数据集上实现了最先进的对象幻觉检测性能，支持实时过滤和干预。

Conclusion: 利用先前被忽视的注意力信号，PAS提供了一种有效检测LVLM对象幻觉的训练免费方法。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

Conclusion: 通过学习切片间关系，CORAL产生了具有解剖信息的表示，有利于下游分割任务，代码已开源。

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Conclusion: SimuFreeMark通过利用低频分量的固有稳定性，成功开发了一种免噪声模拟的水印框架，在保持视觉质量的同时显著提升了对抗多种攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

TL;DR: DocSLM是一种高效的小型视觉语言模型，专为资源受限的边缘设备上的长文档理解而设计，通过分层多模态压缩器和流式弃权机制，在减少82%视觉标记、75%参数和71%延迟的同时，达到或超越最先进方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在长复杂文档上表现出强大的多模态推理能力，但其高内存占用使其难以在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。

Method: DocSLM采用分层多模态压缩器联合编码每页的视觉、文本和布局信息为固定长度序列，并通过基于熵的不确定性校准器的流式弃权机制进行可扩展处理。

Result: 在多个长多模态文档基准测试中，DocSLM在使用82%更少视觉标记、75%更少参数和71%更低延迟的情况下，匹配或超越了最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: DocSLM能够在轻量级边缘设备上提供可靠的多模态文档理解，解决了大型模型在资源受限环境中的部署问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices. Code is available in the supplementary material.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YCB-Ev SD是一个用于6DoF物体姿态估计的标准分辨率事件相机合成数据集，包含50,000个事件序列，填补了事件视觉领域缺乏全面合成数据的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前帧基计算机视觉中合成数据已很普遍，但事件视觉领域缺乏可比的综合资源，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 基于物理渲染(PBR)场景，采用模拟线性相机运动确保完整场景覆盖，包括背景活动，遵循BOP方法学生成事件序列。

Result: 系统评估表明，具有线性衰减和双通道极性编码的时间表面在CNN推理中表现最佳，显著优于指数衰减和单通道替代方案。极性信息对性能提升贡献最大。

Conclusion: 该数据集以结构化格式提供原始事件流和预计算的最优表示，便于即时研究使用和可重复基准测试，已公开可用。

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.

*Sheng Liu,Yuanzhi Liang,Sidan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free3D是一个无需3D运动标注的3D人体运动生成框架，通过2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜在空间，并引入视图一致性、方向连贯性和物理合理性等正则化目标，实现与3D监督方法相当甚至更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型虽然重建精度高，但难以泛化到训练分布之外，这源于精确3D监督使模型过度拟合固定坐标模式，而非学习必要的3D结构和运动语义线索。

Method: 提出Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ)将2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜在空间，并设计了一套3D无监督正则化目标，包括视图一致性、方向连贯性和物理合理性约束。

Result: 仅使用2D运动数据训练的Free3D能够生成多样化、时间连贯且语义对齐的3D运动，性能与完全3D监督方法相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: 放松显式3D监督能够促进更强的结构推理和泛化能力，为3D运动生成提供了可扩展且数据高效的范式。

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

*Lan Li,Tao Hu,Da-Wei Zhou,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA是一种新颖的类增量学习框架，通过仅调整CLIP的跨模态桥接层来实现高效学习，无需额外参数或推理成本，同时利用正交低秩融合防止遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP应用于类增量学习面临两个主要挑战：(1) 适应下游任务需要额外可学习模块，增加模型复杂性和遗忘风险；(2) 现有方法未能充分利用多模态表示的互补优势。

Method: BOFA框架将所有模型适配限制在CLIP现有的跨模态桥接层，采用正交低秩融合机制将参数更新约束在低秩"安全子空间"，该子空间与过去任务特征正交，确保稳定知识积累。同时使用跨模态混合原型，结合稳定的文本原型和视觉对应物。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，BOFA在准确性和效率方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BOFA通过桥接层正交融合实现了高效且稳定的类增量学习，无需数据回放即可防止遗忘，同时充分利用了多模态表示的优势。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割方法在准确性和速度方面存在不足，监督学习方法需要大量标注数据，而无监督方法分割时间长且精度较差。

Method: 将HMRF理论与CNN分割相结合，利用HMRF的邻域和类别分布概念，开发了HMRF-UNet模型，并研究了不同邻域项和组件对无监督HMRF损失的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的方法结合了无监督学习和快速分割的优势，预训练策略显著减少了训练分割模型所需的标注数据量。

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

TL;DR: 提出LSEF框架，基于低秩稀疏原理将情感动态建模为层次化低秩稀疏组合过程，通过三个模块分别捕获情感基础、分离瞬时波动并重建多尺度一致性，显著提升了视频情感计算的鲁棒性和动态判别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频情感计算面临模型不稳定和表征退化问题，核心限制是缺乏层次化结构机制来解耦不同的情感成分（情感基础和瞬时波动）。

Method: 提出低秩稀疏情感理解框架（LSEF），包含三个即插即用模块：稳定性编码模块捕获低秩情感基础，动态解耦模块分离稀疏瞬时信号，一致性集成模块重建多尺度稳定性与反应性一致性，并通过秩感知优化策略自适应平衡梯度平滑性和敏感性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证实，LSEF显著增强了鲁棒性和动态判别能力。

Conclusion: 层次化低秩稀疏建模对于理解情感动态具有有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

Motivation: 解决生物医学成像中多模态大语言模型科学推理能力受限于大规模高质量训练数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 三阶段构建方法：1）从同行评审文章中获取专家验证的图-标题对；2）使用HiCQA-Graph异构图融合NLI文本蕴含、CLIP视觉语言对齐和智能体信号来过滤不一致样本；3）用MLLM生成多选题并进行人工筛选。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的数据构建方法，结合专家文献、图基过滤和人工精炼，能够显著提升显微镜推理性能，证明数据质量对MLLM性能的关键作用。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要建立系统评估框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出三层次评估框架：粗粒度质量评分、中粒度失真类型识别、细粒度失真强度分类，并使用思维链提示进行增强。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs具有初步DIQA能力，但存在评分不一致、失真误识别和强度误判等关键限制，思维链提示能显著提升所有层次的表现。

Conclusion: 该工作为MLLMs的DIQA能力提供了基准，揭示了其在质量感知方面的明显缺陷，并指出了改进的可行路径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

*Lukun Wu,Jie Li,Ziqi Ren,Kaifan Zhang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出自适应教学范式来解决视觉-脑电信号的不对称对齐问题，通过让视觉模态动态调整其知识结构来匹配脑电模态的能力，在零样本脑到图像检索任务中达到60.2%的top-1准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉和脑电模态之间存在根本性的不对称性，包括保真度差距（EEG噪声与视觉高保真特征）和语义差距（EEG浅层概念表示与视觉丰富语义深度）。传统方法忽视这种不对称性，强制对齐两个模态导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出自适应教学范式，让"教师"模态（视觉）在任务指导下动态收缩和调整知识结构，使其语义密集特征匹配"学生"模态（EEG）的能力。实现该范式的ShrinkAdapter模块采用无残差设计和瓶颈结构。

Result: 在零样本脑到图像检索任务中达到60.2%的top-1准确率，比之前最先进方法提升了9.8%。

Conclusion: 引入不对称对齐的新视角：教师必须收缩和适应来弥合视觉-脑电差距。

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

Conclusion: WEAVE为多模态社区研究上下文交织理解和生成提供了视角和基础，揭示了当前方法在多轮上下文感知图像生成和编辑中的持续挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM是一个受大脑启发的条件扩散框架，通过将fMRI信号按视觉皮层层次结构分组并转换为多尺度皮层金字塔，在去噪过程中注入尺度特定提示，实现高效可解释的图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的解码器直接使用fMRI特征，忽略了大脑的层次处理结构，模糊了早期、中期和晚期视觉区域的不同作用。

Method: 使用ROI适配器将fMRI分组为早期/中期/晚期流，转换为与U-Net深度对齐的多尺度皮层金字塔，通过轻量级ControlNet在去噪过程中注入尺度特定提示。

Result: 在自然场景数据集(NSD)上，Hi-DREAM在高层次语义指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持竞争力的低层次保真度。

Conclusion: 按皮层层次结构组织条件化是纯数据驱动嵌入的强大替代方案，为研究视觉皮层提供了有用视角。

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM基准测试缺乏对视觉提示（如边界框）理解能力的系统评估，而这是人类用户自然使用的交互方式，需要明确当前模型是否能有效识别和利用视觉提示。

Method: 采用两阶段评估框架：第一阶段测试模型在自然场景中感知视觉提示的能力，使用30k个可视化提示，涵盖8种形状和355种属性组合；第二阶段评估视觉提示对下游任务的影响。

Result: 评估了28个MLLM模型（包括GPT-4o、InternVL3、Qwen2.5-VL等），全面分析了影响视觉提示理解的因素，如提示属性变化、问题安排和模型规模等。

Conclusion: VP-Bench为研究MLLM如何理解和解决基于视觉提示的参考问题建立了新的参考框架，填补了现有基准测试的空白。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

Conclusion: 使用平衡合成数据进行微调可以有效解决真实世界数据中的偏见和分布不平衡问题，并提高模型在真实场景中的性能表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

TL;DR: 提出了MaMOL框架，通过双路由机制将模态缺失问题重新表述为多任务学习问题，实现参数高效的缺失模态适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感多模态分类常因环境干扰、传感器故障或大气效应导致模态缺失，严重影响分类性能。现有两阶段适应方法计算成本高且假设训练时具有完整多模态数据，限制了其在真实世界不完整性下的泛化能力。

Method: 提出缺失感知的Lora混合框架，包含任务导向的动态路由器和模态特定共享的静态路由器。动态路由器针对不同缺失模式自适应激活专家，静态路由器保持稳定的跨模态知识共享。通过轻量级专家更新和共享专家重用实现参数高效适应。

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中，在不同缺失率下表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力，计算开销最小。在自然图像数据集上的迁移实验验证了其可扩展性和跨域适用性。

Conclusion: MaMOL为不完整多模态学习提供了一个通用且高效的解决方案，具有出色的鲁棒性、泛化能力和计算效率。

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于免疫组织化学的PD-L1表达评估方法资源密集，需要开发更高效的替代方案。

Method: 基于nnUNet-v2构建贝叶斯分割框架，在循环训练期间采样多样化模型检查点来近似后验分布，通过熵和标准差进行不确定性估计。

Result: 在肺鳞状细胞癌数据集上，平均Dice分数0.805，平均IoU 0.709，性能与现有基线方法相当，同时提供像素级不确定性图谱。

Conclusion: 基于H&E的不确定性感知PD-L1预测是朝着临床工作流程中可扩展、可解释生物标志物评估的有前景的一步。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种轻量级的跨模态融合模块，通过在视觉和文本编码器顶部添加少量双向交叉注意力层，在保持编码器非因果性和高效性的同时实现更好的模态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型要么在编码器早期融合特征，要么在后期比较池化嵌入，但两种模态的隐藏状态已经包含丰富的模态特定结构，直接对齐这些状态是更自然的方式。

Method: 在视觉和文本编码器顶部放置少量仅交叉的双向注意力层，将隐藏状态投影到共享空间，进行跨模态注意力计算，并通过门控残差更新返回，使用简单稳定器改善对齐。

Result: 在标准检索、VQA和视觉推理基准测试中，BRIDGE优于可比较的视觉语言模型，同时保持对比模型的双编码器效率。

Conclusion: BRIDGE提供了一种高效且有效的跨模态融合方法，在保持编码器理解能力的同时实现了更好的模态对齐性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出人工智能伦理熵的第二定律，证明无约束AI会自发偏离目标，需要持续对齐工作来维持稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将AI对齐问题重新定义为连续热力学控制问题，为高级自主系统的稳定性和安全性提供量化基础。

Method: 定义伦理熵S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta)，证明其时间导数dS/dt ≥ 0，推导对齐工作临界稳定性边界gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N。

Result: 70亿参数模型从初始熵0.32漂移到1.69±1.08纳特，而对齐工作gamma=20.4的系统保持稳定在0.00±0.00纳特。

Conclusion: AI对齐需要持续的热力学式控制，该框架为维持先进自主系统的稳定性和安全提供了量化基础。

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多目标决策问题需要从帕累托最优解集中选择最具代表性的子集，以减轻决策者的认知负担。现有质量度量方法存在一些不直观的行为，需要改进。

Method: 将帕累托剪枝问题重新定义为多赢家投票问题，进行公理分析，提出新的定向覆盖度量方法，分析计算复杂性，并进行实验评估。

Result: 发现现有质量度量方法存在不直观行为，提出的定向覆盖度量方法在各种设置下表现具有竞争力甚至更优，确定了目标数量和结构对计算复杂性的影响边界。

Conclusion: 质量度量的选择对所选解集的特征有决定性影响，新提出的定向覆盖度量方法在多种设置下表现良好，为帕累托剪枝问题提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了图参数clique-width在编码中的应用，特别针对抽象论证框架设计了新的归约方法，将论证问题转化为(Q)SAT问题，并保持clique-width的线性不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代SAT求解器在树宽较小的实例上表现高效，但对于更一般的图参数clique-width的编码能力了解甚少。本文旨在探索基于clique-width的编码能力，选择抽象论证作为研究案例，因为它基于有向图且具有计算挑战性。

Method: 设计了从论证问题到(Q)SAT问题的新归约方法，这些归约线性保持clique-width，形成了有向分解引导(DDG)归约。

Result: 为所有论证语义（包括计数）建立了新的结果，证明DDG归约引起的开销在合理假设下无法显著改进。

Conclusion: 本文开启了基于clique-width理解编码能力的研究，通过抽象论证框架展示了DDG归约的有效性，并为论证语义提供了新的计算洞察。

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Motivation: 在不确定性下进行反事实决策时，决策者通常需要比较候选行动的期望潜在结果。现有方法存在局限，需要新的度量指标来更好地评估行动偏好。

Method: 引入PoR和PoB两个新指标，建立识别定理和边界推导，提出估计方法，并通过数值实验验证估计器的有限样本特性。

Conclusion: PoR和PoB为反事实决策提供了新的分析工具，能够更有效地评估个体层面的行动偏好和最优结果达成概率。

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

Conclusion: HyperComplEx通过自适应维度分配实现近线性扩展，为可扩展知识图谱嵌入研究提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

TL;DR: 本文研究了多智能体辩论中的角色分配策略，发现"真理最后"策略可将推理任务性能提升22%，并提出基于一致性的MADC策略来优化多智能体辩论机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体扩展研究中，多智能体辩论的角色分配策略关键作用未被充分探索，特别是在实际应用中真理未知的情况下需要更有效的策略。

Method: 提出Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC)策略，通过路径一致性评估独立角色间的一致性，将一致性最高的角色模拟为真理，系统优化多智能体辩论核心机制。

Result: 在9个LLM模型上的验证显示，MADC策略持续表现出先进性能，有效克服了MAD的性能瓶颈，推理任务性能提升最高达22%。

Conclusion: MADC为LLM智能体扩展提供了关键改进路径，通过一致性驱动的角色分配策略显著提升了多智能体辩论在推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的广义规划方法，通过从训练问题中学习条件-动作规则来构建可执行的广义规划程序，这些规则可以直接执行或用于剪枝规划搜索空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 广义规划旨在合成能够解决相关规划问题族的程序，现有方法在合成成本、规划覆盖率和解质量方面存在改进空间。

Method: 对每个训练问题，按顺序为每个目标原子计算最优规划，对结果规划执行目标回归，并将输出提升为一阶条件→动作规则集合。

Result: 实验表明，在经典和数值规划领域中，该方法在合成成本、规划覆盖率和解质量三个指标上相比最先进的（广义）规划器有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法能够学习有效的广义规划和搜索空间剪枝公理，为广义规划提供了一种简单而有效的新方法。

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

Conclusion: 几何构造为评估统一多模态模型的生成推理能力提供了理想测试平台，GGBench填补了现有评估方法的空白。

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

Method: MUG协议借鉴社交推理游戏，通过修改参考图像引入反事实证据，观察智能体是否能准确识别这些变化，从而检测幻觉智能体。

Result: MUG在三个关键维度上改进了MAD协议：实现基于反事实测试的事实验证、引入跨证据推理、促进主动推理。

Conclusion: MUG为LLMs的多模态推理提供了一个更可靠有效的框架，能够更好地处理幻觉问题。

Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.

Method: STaR框架通过显式建模逐步思考和不确定性感知推理来装备LLMs慢思考能力，训练阶段采用两阶段难度感知强化学习，推理阶段通过整合token级置信度和答案一致性进行轨迹级不确定性量化。

Result: 在基准测试中，STaR实现了优越性能和增强的推理稳定性，在域外数据集上也表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: STaR作为基于认知启发的可靠解决方案，在LLMs表格推理方面展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

Conclusion: 该方法为AI决策提供了实用的可追溯性解决方案，有助于建立责任链，确保AI决策在法律框架下的可问责性。

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型存在复杂的越狱漏洞，现有对齐方法在安全性、效用和运营成本之间难以平衡，且仅关注最终输出的过程盲目性会浪费大量计算资源在不安全的推理上。

Method: 提出EcoAlign框架，将模型对齐重构为经济理性搜索问题，增量扩展思维图，使用前瞻性函数（类似净现值）对行动评分，动态权衡预期安全性、效用和成本，并通过最弱链接原则强制执行路径安全性。

Result: 在3个闭源和2个开源模型的6个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EcoAlign在较低计算成本下达到或超越了最先进的安全性和效用水平。

Conclusion: EcoAlign为强大的LVLM对齐提供了一条原则性、经济高效的路径，解决了安全、效用和成本之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了一个可扩展的、以人为中心的方法论，有效整合认知科学和机器学习，用于现实世界的社会导航。

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

Conclusion: MarsRL展示了在多智能体推理系统中联合优化所有智能体的潜力，能够显著提升推理性能并扩大其在不同推理任务中的适用性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has been propelled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and test-time scaling. However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

Conclusion: 多模态电子健康记录整合有潜力增强临床决策制定并改善患者预后。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AFA的注意力特征聚合方法，通过轻量级的可训练池化机制，让视觉运动策略能够专注于任务相关的视觉线索，忽略干扰信息，从而提高在视觉扰动场景下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉表示虽然强大，但可能编码大量与任务无关的场景信息，导致训练出的视觉运动策略在面对域外视觉变化和干扰物时缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出注意力特征聚合(AFA)，这是一种轻量级的可训练池化机制，能够学习自然地关注任务相关的视觉线索，忽略语义丰富的场景干扰物。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的广泛实验中，使用AFA训练的策略在存在视觉扰动的情况下显著优于标准池化方法，且不需要昂贵的数据集增强或PVR微调。

Conclusion: 忽略无关视觉信息是部署鲁棒且可泛化的视觉运动策略的关键步骤。

Abstract: The adoption of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs), leveraging features from large-scale vision models, has become a popular paradigm for training visuomotor policies. However, these powerful representations can encode a broad range of task-irrelevant scene information, making the resulting trained policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors. In this work we address visuomotor policy feature pooling as a solution to the observed lack of robustness in perturbed scenes. We achieve this via Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues, ignoring even semantically rich scene distractors. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or fine-tuning of the PVR. Our findings show that ignoring extraneous visual information is a crucial step towards deploying robust and generalisable visuomotor policies. Project Page: tsagkas.github.io/afa

Abstract: As social robots increasingly enter public environments, their acceptance depends not only on technical reliability but also on ethical integrity, accessibility, and user trust. This paper reports on a pilot deployment of an ARI social robot functioning as a university receptionist, designed in alignment with the SecuRoPS framework for secure and ethical social robot deployment. Thirty-five students and staff interacted with the robot and provided structured feedback on safety, privacy, usability, accessibility, and transparency. The results show generally positive perceptions of physical safety, data protection, and ethical behavior, while also highlighting challenges related to accessibility, inclusiveness, and dynamic interaction. Beyond the empirical findings, the study demonstrates how theoretical frameworks for ethical and secure design can be implemented in real-world contexts through end-user evaluation. It also provides a public GitHub repository containing reusable templates for ARI robot applications to support reproducibility and lower the entry barrier for new researchers. By combining user perspectives with practical technical resources, this work contributes to ongoing discussions in AI and society and supports the development of trustworthy, inclusive, and ethically responsible social robots for public spaces.

Abstract: Searches are conducted to find missing persons and/or objects given uncertain information, imperfect observers and large search areas in Search and Rescue (SAR). In many scenarios, such as Maritime SAR, expected survival times are short and optimal search could increase the likelihood of success. This optimization problem is complex for nontrivial problems given its probabilistic nature.
  Stochastic optimization methods search large problems by nondeterministically sampling the space to reduce the effective size of the problem. This has been used in SAR planning to search otherwise intractably large problems but the stochastic nature provides no formal guarantees on the quality of solutions found in finite time.
  This paper instead presents $\rm{A}^{\rm{SAR}}$, an $\varepsilon$-optimal search algorithm for SAR planning. It calculates a heuristic to bound the search space and uses graph-search methods to find solutions that are formally guaranteed to be within a user-specified factor, $\varepsilon$, of the optimal solution. It finds better solutions faster than existing optimization approaches in operational simulations. It is also demonstrated with a real-world field trial on Lake Ontario, Canada, where it was used to locate a drifting manikin in only 150s.

Abstract: Search and rescue (SAR) robots are required to quickly traverse terrain and perform high-force rescue tasks, necessitating both terrain adaptability and controlled high-force output. Few platforms exist today for SAR, and fewer still have the ability to cover both tasks of terrain adaptability and high-force output when performing extraction. While legged robots offer significant ability to traverse uneven terrain, they typically are unable to incorporate mechanisms that provide variable high-force outputs, unlike traditional wheel-based drive trains. This work introduces a novel concept for a dynamically extensible and retractable robot leg. Leveraging a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage design, it allows for mechanically switching between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations via a geometric transformation. A testbed evaluated leg performance across linkage geometries and operating modes, with empirical and analytical analyses conducted on stride length, force output, and stability. The results demonstrate that the morphing leg offers a promising path toward SAR robots that can both navigate terrain quickly and perform rescue tasks effectively.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel decentralized approach for achieving emergent behavior in multi-agent systems with minimal information sharing. Based on prior work in simple orbits, our method produces a broad class of stable, periodic trajectories by stabilizing the system around a Lie group-based geometric embedding. Employing the Lie group SO(3), we generate a wider range of periodic curves than existing quaternion-based methods. Furthermore, we exploit SO(3) properties to eliminate the need for velocity inputs, allowing agents to receive only position inputs. We also propose a novel phase controller that ensures uniform agent separation, along with a formal stability proof. Validation through simulations and experiments showcases the method's adaptability to complex low-level dynamics and disturbances.

Abstract: Quantifying greenhouse-gases (GHG) in wetlands is critical for climate modeling and restoration assessment, yet manual sampling is labor-intensive, and time demanding. We present WetExplorer, an autonomous tracked robot that automates the full GHG-sampling workflow. The robot system integrates low-ground-pressure locomotion, centimeter-accurate lift placement, dual-RTK sensor fusion, obstacle avoidance planning, and deep-learning perception in a containerized ROS2 stack.

Abstract: Coordinating a team of robots to reposition multiple objects in cluttered environments requires reasoning jointly about where robots should establish contact, how to manipulate objects once contact is made, and how to navigate safely and efficiently at scale. Prior approaches typically fall into two extremes -- either learning the entire task or relying on privileged information and hand-designed planners -- both of which struggle to handle diverse objects in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for collaborative multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation that integrates flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning. Within this framework, a generative model co-generates contact formations and manipulation trajectories from visual observations, while a novel motion planner conveys robots at scale. Crucially, the same planner also supports coordination at the object level, assigning manipulated objects to larger target structures and thereby unifying robot- and object-level reasoning within a single algorithmic framework. Experiments in challenging simulated environments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks, highlighting the benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning for scaling collaborative manipulation to complex multi-agent, multi-object settings.

Abstract: Most engineered pilings require substantially more force to be driven into the ground than they can resist during extraction. This requires relatively heavy equipment for insertion, which is problematic for anchoring in hard-to-access sites, including in extraterrestrial locations. In contrast, for tree roots, the external reaction force required to extract is much greater than required to insert--little more than the weight of the seed initiates insertion. This is partly due to the mechanism by which roots insert into the ground: tip extension. Proof-of-concept robotic prototypes have shown the benefits of using this mechanism, but a rigorous understanding of the underlying granular mechanics and how they inform the design of a robotic anchor is lacking. Here, we study the terradynamics of tip-extending anchors compared to traditional piling-like intruders, develop a set of design insights, and apply these to create a deployable robotic anchor. Specifically, we identify that to increase an anchor's ratio of extraction force to insertion force, it should: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically, and (iv) incorporate multiple smaller anchors rather than a single large anchor. Synthesizing these insights, we developed a lightweight, soft robotic, root-inspired anchoring device that inserts into the ground with a reaction force less than its weight. We demonstrate that the 300 g device can deploy a series of temperature sensors 45 cm deep into loose Martian regolith simulant while anchoring with an average of 120 N, resulting in an anchoring-to-weight ratio of 40:1.

Abstract: The inherent difficulty and limited scalability of collecting manipulation data using multi-fingered robot hand hardware platforms have resulted in severe data scarcity, impeding research on data-driven dexterous manipulation policy learning. To address this challenge, we present a hand-agnostic manipulation transfer system. It efficiently converts human hand manipulation sequences from demonstration videos into high-quality dexterous manipulation trajectories without requirements of massive training data. To tackle the multi-dimensional disparities between human hands and dexterous hands, as well as the challenges posed by high-degree-of-freedom coordinated control of dexterous hands, we design a progressive transfer framework: first, we establish primary control signals for dexterous hands based on kinematic matching; subsequently, we train residual policies with action space rescaling and thumb-guided initialization to dynamically optimize contact interactions under unified rewards; finally, we compute wrist control trajectories with the objective of preserving operational semantics. Using only human hand manipulation videos, our system automatically configures system parameters for different tasks, balancing kinematic matching and dynamic optimization across dexterous hands, object categories, and tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can automatically generate smooth and semantically correct dexterous hand manipulation that faithfully reproduces human intentions, achieving high efficiency and strong generalizability with an average transfer success rate of 73%, providing an easily implementable and scalable method for collecting robot dexterous manipulation data.

Abstract: Coordination of movement and configuration in robotic swarms is a challenging endeavor. Deciding when and where each individual robot must move is a computationally complex problem. The challenge is further exacerbated by difficulties inherent to physical systems, such as measurement error and control dynamics. Thus, how to best determine the optimal path for each robot, when moving from one configuration to another, and how to best perform such determination and effect corresponding motion remains an open problem. In this paper, we show an algorithm for such coordination of robotic swarms. Our methods allow seamless transition from one configuration to another, leveraging geometric formulations that are mapped to the physical domain through appropriate control, localization, and mapping techniques. This paves the way for novel applications of robotic swarms by enabling more sophisticated distributed behaviors.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持显著效率优势的同时实现了最先进的导航性能，证明了像素级环境预测对导航并非必要。

Abstract: Traditional navigation methods rely heavily on accurate localization and mapping. In contrast, world models that capture environmental dynamics in latent space have opened up new perspectives for navigation tasks, enabling systems to move beyond traditional multi-module pipelines. However, world model often suffers from high computational costs in both training and inference. To address this, we propose LS-NWM - a lightweight latent space navigation world model that is trained and operates entirely in latent space, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, our method reduces training time by approximately 3.2x and planning time by about 447x,while further improving navigation performance with a 35% higher SR and an 11% higher SPL. The key idea is that accurate pixel-wise environmental prediction is unnecessary for navigation. Instead, the model predicts future latent states based on current observational features and action inputs, then performs path planning and decision-making within this compact representation, significantly improving computational efficiency. By incorporating an autoregressive multi-frame prediction strategy during training, the model effectively captures long-term spatiotemporal dependencies, thereby enhancing navigation performance in complex scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance while maintaining a substantial efficiency advantage over existing approaches.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have demonstrated strong capability for interacting with deterministic scenes across locomotion, manipulation, and more challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Yet the real world is dynamic, quasi-static interactions are insufficient to cope with the various environmental conditions. As a step toward more dynamic interaction scenario, we present a reinforcement-learning-based training pipeline that produces a unified whole-body controller for humanoid badminton, enabling coordinated lower-body footwork and upper-body striking without any motion priors or expert demonstrations. Training follows a three-stage curriculum: first footwork acquisition, then precision-guided racket swing generation, and finally task-focused refinement, yielding motions in which both legs and arms serve the hitting objective. For deployment, we incorporate an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate and predict shuttlecock trajectories for target striking. We also introduce a prediction-free variant that dispenses with EKF and explicit trajectory prediction. To validate the framework, we conduct five sets of experiment in both simulation and the real world. In simulation, two robots sustain a rally of 21 consecutive hits. Moreover, the prediction-free variant achieves successful hits with comparable performance relative to the target-known policy. In real-world tests, both the prediction and controller module exhibit high accuracy, and on-court hitting achieves an outgoing shuttle speed up to 10 m/s with a mean return landing distance of 3.5 m. These experiment results show that our humanoid robot can deliver highly dynamic while precise goal striking in badminton, and can be adapted to more dynamism critical domains.

Abstract: Advanced robotic manipulation of deformable, volumetric objects remains one of the greatest challenges due to their pliancy, frailness, variability, and uncertainties during interaction. Motivated by these challenges, this article introduces Sashimi-Bot, an autonomous multi-robotic system for advanced manipulation and cutting, specifically the preparation of sashimi. The objects that we manipulate, salmon loins, are natural in origin and vary in size and shape, they are limp and deformable with poorly characterized elastoplastic parameters, while also being slippery and hard to hold. The three robots straighten the loin; grasp and hold the knife; cut with the knife in a slicing motion while cooperatively stabilizing the loin during cutting; and pick up the thin slices from the cutting board or knife blade. Our system combines deep reinforcement learning with in-hand tool shape manipulation, in-hand tool cutting, and feedback of visual and tactile information to achieve robustness to the variabilities inherent in this task. This work represents a milestone in robotic manipulation of deformable, volumetric objects that may inspire and enable a wide range of other real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉-语言-动作模型在机器人领域具有实现通用操作的巨大潜力，但缺乏系统的真实世界评估和跨模型比较。本文旨在填补这一空白，为实际部署提供实证依据。

Method: 在仿真和ALOHA Mobile平台上对四种VLA模型进行四个操作任务的基准测试，建立标准化评估框架，从准确性效率、适应性和语言指令跟随准确性三个维度进行测量。

Result: π₀在分布外场景中表现出优越的适应性，而ACT在分布内场景中提供最高的稳定性。分析还揭示了计算需求、数据缩放行为和常见失败模式（如近失抓取、过早释放和长时域状态漂移）的差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了VLA模型架构在平衡精度、泛化能力和部署成本方面的实际权衡，为在真实世界机器人操作任务中选择和部署VLA提供了可行的见解。

Abstract: Foundation models applied in robotics, particularly \textbf{Vision--Language--Action (VLA)} models, hold great promise for achieving general-purpose manipulation. Yet, systematic real-world evaluations and cross-model comparisons remain scarce. This paper reports our \textbf{empirical experiences} from benchmarking four representative VLAs -- \textbf{ACT}, \textbf{OpenVLA--OFT}, \textbf{RDT-1B}, and \boldmath{$π_0$} -- across four manipulation tasks conducted in both simulation and on the \textbf{ALOHA Mobile} platform. We establish a \textbf{standardized evaluation framework} that measures performance along three key dimensions: (1) \textit{accuracy and efficiency} (success rate and time-to-success), (2) \textit{adaptability} across in-distribution, spatial out-of-distribution, and instance-plus-spatial out-of-distribution settings, and (3) \textit{language instruction-following accuracy}. Through this process, we observe that \boldmath{$π_0$} demonstrates superior adaptability in out-of-distribution scenarios, while \textbf{ACT} provides the highest stability in-distribution. Further analysis highlights differences in computational demands, data-scaling behavior, and recurring failure modes such as near-miss grasps, premature releases, and long-horizon state drift. These findings reveal practical trade-offs among VLA model architectures in balancing precision, generalization, and deployment cost, offering actionable insights for selecting and deploying VLAs in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Tactile sensing offers rich and complementary information to vision and language, enabling robots to perceive fine-grained object properties. However, existing tactile sensors lack standardization, leading to redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Moreover, existing methods fail to fully integrate the intermediate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities. To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method. TLV-CoRe introduces a Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors and employs tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features. Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment, offering a new direction for multimodal tactile representation.

Abstract: Coverage motion planning is essential to a wide range of robotic tasks. Unlike conventional motion planning problems, which reason over temporal sequences of states, coverage motion planning requires reasoning over the spatial distribution of entire trajectories, making standard motion planning methods limited in computational efficiency and less amenable to modern parallelization frameworks. In this work, we formulate the coverage motion planning problem as a statistical inference problem from the perspective of flow matching, a generative modeling technique that has gained significant attention in recent years. The proposed formulation unifies commonly used statistical discrepancy measures, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Sinkhorn divergence, with a standard linear quadratic regulator problem. More importantly, it decouples the generation of trajectory gradients for coverage from the synthesis of control under nonlinear system dynamics, enabling significant acceleration through parallelization on modern computational architectures, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This paper focuses on the advantages of this formulation in terms of scalability through parallelization, highlighting its computational benefits compared to conventional methods based on waypoint tracking.

Abstract: Training generalist policies for robotic manipulation has shown great promise, as they enable language-conditioned, multi-task behaviors across diverse scenarios. However, evaluating these policies remains difficult because real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It also requires frequent environment resets and carries safety risks when deploying unproven policies on physical robots. Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the often substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage, and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation. Our paper examines the effect of dataset diversity, pre-trained weight and common failure cases for the proposed evaluation pipeline.Our experiments demonstrate that, across various metrics, including policy ranking and the correlation between actual policy values and predicted policy values, these models offer a promising approach for evaluating policies without requiring real-world interactions.

Abstract: Successful autonomous robot navigation in off-road domains requires the ability to generate high-quality terrain costmaps that are able to both generalize well over a wide variety of terrains and rapidly adapt relative costs at test time to meet mission-specific needs. Existing approaches for costmap generation allow for either rapid test-time adaptation of relative costs (e.g., semantic segmentation methods) or generalization to new terrain types (e.g., representation learning methods), but not both. In this work, we present scaled preference conditioned all-terrain costmap generation (SPACER), a novel approach for generating terrain costmaps that leverages synthetic data during training in order to generalize well to new terrains, and allows for rapid test-time adaptation of relative costs by conditioning on a user-specified scaled preference context. Using large-scale aerial maps, we provide empirical evidence that SPACER outperforms other approaches at generating costmaps for terrain navigation, with the lowest measured regret across varied preferences in five of seven environments for global path planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集通常呈现长尾分布，少数头部类别占主导，许多尾部类别严重不足。现有参数高效微调方法虽然能保持尾部类别性能，但会牺牲头部类别准确性，且头尾比例这一关键因素被忽视。

Method: 提出LT-Soups两阶段模型融合框架：第一阶段在平衡子集上微调模型并取平均以减少头部类别偏差；第二阶段仅在全数据集上微调分类器以恢复头部类别准确性。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验表明，LT-Soups在广泛的失衡机制下相比参数高效微调和传统模型融合方法实现了更优的权衡。

Conclusion: LT-Soups框架能够有效处理长尾分布中的头尾类别权衡问题，在不同失衡机制下都表现出色。

Abstract: Real-world datasets typically exhibit long-tailed (LT) distributions, where a few head classes dominate and many tail classes are severely underrepresented. While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($ρ$) and head-tail ratio ($η$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of governing equations from data remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics. Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient finetuning (PEFT) enhances model performance on downstream tasks by updating a minimal subset of parameters. Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: While generative models have become increasingly prevalent across various domains, fundamental concerns regarding their reliability persist. A crucial yet understudied aspect of these models is the uncertainty quantification surrounding their distribution approximation capabilities. Current evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on measuring the closeness between the learned and the target distributions, neglecting the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. In this position paper, we formalize the problem of uncertainty quantification in generative model learning. We discuss potential research directions, including the use of ensemble-based precision-recall curves. Our preliminary experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of aggregated precision-recall curves in capturing model approximation uncertainty, enabling systematic comparison among different model architectures based on their uncertainty characteristics.

Motivation: 直接计算完整的NTK矩阵在计算上不可行，特别是对于循环架构。需要一种高效的方法来分析有限宽度NTK，以支持更快的分析和应用。

Method: 采用矩阵自由视角，使用迹估计技术，特别是Hutch++迹估计器。利用NTK的结构特性，开发了仅需前向或反向自动微分的单边估计器。

Result: 矩阵自由随机化方法可以实现多个数量级的加速，在低样本情况下单边估计器优于Hutch++，特别是在模型状态与参数数量差距较大时表现更好。

Conclusion: 矩阵自由随机化方法为NTK分析提供了高效的解决方案，显著加速了NTK的计算和应用，特别是在计算资源受限的情况下。

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) characterizes how a model's state evolves over Gradient Descent. Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures. Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large. In total, our results demonstrate that matrix-free randomized approaches can yield speedups of many orders of magnitude, leading to faster analysis and applications of the NTK.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种改进线性预测聚类（LPC）全局优化效率的新方法，通过利用可分离性的理论特性推导出具有可证明误差界的近似最优解，显著降低了混合整数规划（MIP）的复杂性并提高了可扩展性。

Method: 1. 利用可分离性的关键理论特性推导出具有可证明误差界的近似最优解，显著降低MIP公式的复杂性；2. 将LPC进一步近似为二次伪布尔优化（QPBO）问题，在某些设置下实现显著的计算改进。

Conclusion: 本文提出的两种新方法在保证近似全局最优的同时，显著提高了LPC的计算效率和可扩展性，为在非可分离聚类设置中实现高效全局优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Linear Predictive Clustering (LPC) partitions samples based on shared linear relationships between feature and target variables, with numerous applications including marketing, medicine, and education. Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.

Motivation: 使用数学问题作为工具来理解、解释并可能改进语言模型，特别是研究Transformer如何学习复杂算术函数的控制结构。

Method: 使用不同基数编码输入和输出，训练Transformer模型预测Collatz序列的长步长，分析模型学习模式和错误类型。

Result: 模型准确率随编码基数变化显著（24和32基数达99.7%，11和3基数仅37%和25%），所有模型都学习基于模2^p余数的输入分类，错误主要源于循环长度估计错误而非计算错误。

Conclusion: 学习复杂算术函数的主要困难在于理解计算的控制结构（循环长度），使用数学问题分析语言模型的方法可广泛应用于其他问题并产生丰硕成果。

Abstract: We investigate transformer prediction of long Collatz steps, a complex arithmetic function that maps odd integers to their distant successors in the Collatz sequence ( $u_{n+1}=u_n/2$ if $u_n$ is even, $u_{n+1}=(3u_n+1)/2$ if $u_n$ is odd). Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops. We believe that the approach outlined here, using mathematical problems as tools for understanding, explaining, and perhaps improving language models, can be applied to a broad range of problems and bear fruitful results.

Abstract: Although neural operators are widely used in data-driven physical simulations, their training remains computationally expensive. Recent advances address this issue via downstream learning, where a model pretrained on simpler problems is fine-tuned on more complex ones. In this research, we investigate transformer-based neural operators, which have previously been applied only to specific problems, in a more general transfer learning setting. We evaluate their performance across diverse PDE problems, including extrapolation to unseen parameters, incorporation of new variables, and transfer from multi-equation datasets. Our results demonstrate that advanced neural operator architectures can effectively transfer knowledge across PDE problems.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their practical advantage on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ansätze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.

Abstract: Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowPath提出了一种通过可逆神经流学习控制路径几何形状的新方法，用于处理稀疏和不规则采样的时间序列建模问题，相比固定插值方法显著提升了分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经控制微分方程在建模稀疏和不规则采样时间序列时，其性能高度依赖于从离散观测构建的控制路径选择。现有固定插值方法强加了简化的几何假设，往往无法准确表示底层数据流形，特别是在高缺失率情况下。

Method: FlowPath通过可逆神经流学习控制路径的几何形状，构建连续且数据自适应的流形，通过可逆性约束强制信息保持和良好行为的变换，这与先前无约束可学习路径模型不同。

Result: 在18个基准数据集和真实世界案例研究上的实证评估表明，FlowPath在使用固定插值或不可逆架构的基线方法上，分类准确性始终实现统计显著改进。

Conclusion: 结果强调了不仅需要建模沿路径的动力学，还需要建模路径本身的几何形状的重要性，为从不规则时间序列学习提供了鲁棒且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse and irregularly-sampled time series remains a fundamental challenge. Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures. These results highlight the importance of modeling not only the dynamics along the path but also the geometry of the path itself, offering a robust and generalizable solution for learning from irregular time series.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种利用行为策略收集离线数据的方法，通过降低回报估计方差来提高强化学习算法的样本效率和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法依赖回报估计进行策略改进，但高方差的回报估计会导致样本效率低下和训练不稳定。最近研究表明，精心设计的行为策略可以收集离线数据来获得方差更低的回报估计。

Method: 将离线策略评估的关键见解扩展到在线强化学习设置中，使用单一行为策略收集数据用于策略改进，通过重要性采样进行偏差校正和方差管理。

Result: 在两个策略梯度方法上应用该机制，在多样化环境中展示了更好的样本效率和性能表现。

Conclusion: 收集在线数据并不一定是方差最优的，通过精心设计的行为策略收集离线数据可以获得方差更低的回报估计，从而提高强化学习算法的效率。

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.

Conclusion: STAMP适配器参数量轻、输入灵活，支持使用通用TSFM轻松建模EEG数据，为EEG分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on data from multiple domains have shown strong performance on diverse modeling tasks. Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.

Motivation: 现有代码选择算法可能无法识别正确程序，因为它们可能错误识别非等价程序，或者依赖LLM并假设它总能正确确定每个输入的输出。

Method: 提出ExPairT-LLM算法，通过向LLM提出成对成员资格和成对等价性查询，通过锦标赛方式识别正确程序，对某些LLM错误具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个流行代码数据集上，ExPairT-LLM的pass@1成功率平均比最先进代码选择算法提升13.0%，最高提升27.1%，并将执行复杂推理的LLM的pass@1提升24.0%。

Conclusion: ExPairT-LLM通过引入更简单的查询类型和锦标赛机制，有效提高了代码选择的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in LLMs, the task of code generation is still challenging. To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.

Conclusion: 利用公共数据辅助的零阶优化方法能够有效解决差分隐私机器学习中的计算效率问题，在保持隐私保护的同时显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: One of the major bottlenecks for deploying popular first-order differentially private (DP) machine learning algorithms (e.g., DP-SGD) lies in their high computation and memory cost, despite the existence of optimized implementations. Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\times$ runtime speedup.

Abstract: Training data imbalance poses a major challenge for code LLMs. Most available data heavily over represents raw opensource code while underrepresenting broader software engineering tasks, especially in low resource languages like Golang. As a result, models excel at code autocompletion but struggle with real world developer workflows such as unit test generation. To address this gap, we introduce GO UT Bench, a benchmark dataset of 5264 pairs of code and unit tests, drawn from 10 permissively licensed Golang repositories spanning diverse domain. We evaluate its effectiveness as a fine tuning dataset across two LLM families i.e. mixture of experts and dense decoders. Our results show that finetuned models outperform their base counterparts on more than 75% of benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: G4RL方法通过图编码器-解码器有效解决了GCHRL中的关键挑战，在对称可逆转换环境类别中显著提升了现有方法的性能。

Abstract: The integration of graphs with Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL) has recently gained attention, as intermediate goals (subgoals) can be effectively sampled from graphs that naturally represent the overall task structure in most RL tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration. Empirical results indicate that leveraging high and low-level intrinsic rewards from the graph encoder-decoder significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with an extra small computational cost in dense and sparse reward environments.

Conclusion: PI-MJCA-BiGRU框架能够实现时间高效的推理，提供生理一致的肌肉激活和力量估计，为临床评估和辅助设备控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems is critical for clinical assessment and assistive device control. However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.

Conclusion: SPP-FGC通过本地结构图作为隐私保护知识共享媒介，成功解决了联邦聚类中性能与隐私的权衡问题，提供了高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated clustering addresses the critical challenge of extracting patterns from decentralized, unlabeled data. However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving clustering accuracy by up to 10\% (NMI) over federated baselines while maintaining provable privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: GraphToxin揭示了图遗忘方法面临严重隐私风险，迫切需要开发更有效和鲁棒的防御策略来应对此类攻击。

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with "the right to be forgotten" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.

Method: 分析四种决策策略：Explore-then-Commit、Action Elimination、Lower Confidence Bound (LCB)和Thompson Sampling，并为每种策略提供尖锐的理论遗憾保证。

Result: 与经典赌博机设置不同，Explore-then-Commit和Action Elimination因在探索阶段后承诺固定排序而遭受次优遗憾。相比之下，LCB和Thompson Sampling基于观察到的反馈持续更新决策，实现常数O(1)遗憾。模拟证实了这些理论发现。

Conclusion: 在不确定性下，自适应性对于高效边缘推理起着关键作用，LCB和Thompson Sampling因持续自适应而优于固定排序策略。

Abstract: Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.

Abstract: Model merging combines expert models for multitask performance but faces challenges from parameter interference. This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks. Experimental results show our method generates a superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing domain shifts. Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.

Conclusion: 该方法在各类知识图谱嵌入学习模型中均表现出优势，能有效减少灾难性遗忘并提升学习效率。

Abstract: Many Knowledege Graphs (KGs) are frequently updated, forcing their Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to adapt to these changes. To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings. Finally, its benefits across various types of KGE learning models are demonstrated.

Abstract: Detecting point anomalies in bank account balances is essential for financial institutions, as it enables the identification of potential fraud, operational issues, or other irregularities. Robust statistics is useful for flagging outliers and for providing estimates of the data distribution parameters that are not affected by contaminated observations. However, such a strategy is often less efficient and computationally expensive under high dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose and evaluate empirically several robust approaches that may be computationally efficient in medium and high dimensional datasets, with high breakdown points and low computational time. Our application deals with around 2.6 million daily records of anonymous users' bank account balances.

Conclusion: 研究表明可解释AI能够提供准确的降水预报和对不同城市环境中降水模式的透明洞察。

Abstract: Deep learning models for precipitation forecasting often function as black boxes, limiting their adoption in real-world weather prediction. To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata. This study demonstrates how explainable AI (xAI) can provide accurate forecasts and transparent insights into precipitation patterns in diverse urban environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving predictions of climate extreme events, specifically heat waves, using machine learning methods. Our work is framed as a classification problem in which we try to predict whether surface air temperature will exceed its q-th local quantile within a specified timeframe. Our key finding is that aggregating ensemble predictions using a power mean significantly enhances the classifier's performance. By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model. Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合稀疏识别和卡尔曼滤波的实时学习方法——Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF)，用于从数据中实时学习非线性动力系统的控制方程，特别适用于参数漂移或切换的复杂系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从数据中学习控制方程对于理解物理系统行为至关重要，但现有方法难以处理实时学习和时变参数的问题，需要将稀疏识别方法与实时滤波技术相结合。

Method: 将Sindy算法与卡尔曼滤波器结合，将未知系统参数视为状态变量，通过前瞻误差增强参数识别策略，简化稀疏水平、方差参数和切换时刻的估计。

Result: 在具有漂移或切换参数的混沌Lorenz系统上验证了SKF的有效性，并在真实飞行数据构建的稀疏非线性飞机模型中展示了实时识别能力。

Conclusion: SKF统一了稀疏识别和卡尔曼滤波框架，能够实时推断复杂时变非线性模型，解决了单独使用任一方法无法实现的问题，显著提升了参数识别性能。

Abstract: Learning governing equations from data is central to understanding the behavior of physical systems across diverse scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, and engineering. The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we extend sparsity-driven approaches to real-time learning by integrating a cornerstone algorithm from control theory -- the Kalman filter (KF). The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants. We validate SKF on a chaotic Lorenz system with drifting or switching parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness in the real-time identification of a sparse nonlinear aircraft model built from real flight data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DGIMVCM的动态深度图学习方法，用于解决不完整多视图聚类问题，通过构建缺失鲁棒全局图、动态视图特定图结构、掩码图重构损失等创新方法提升聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多视图数据普遍存在不完整性，现有基于GNN的不完整多视图聚类方法存在两个主要问题：使用KNN构建静态图会引入噪声降低鲁棒性；直接使用MSE损失作为图重构损失会在优化过程中产生大量梯度噪声。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了DGIMVCM方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: DGIMVCM方法通过动态深度图学习和掩码图重构损失，有效解决了不完整多视图聚类中的图构建噪声和梯度噪声问题，显著提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: The prevalence of real-world multi-view data makes incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) a crucial research. The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{D}ynamic Deep \textbf{G}raph Learning for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{C}lustering with \textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of DGIMVCM.

TL;DR: LoRaCompass是一种强化学习模型，用于在未知环境中高效定位LoRa标签，通过空间感知特征提取和策略蒸馏损失函数解决信号波动和域偏移问题，在80km²区域内实现90%以上的定位成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的LoRa标签定位方法容易受到域偏移和信号波动的影响，导致决策错误累积和定位不准确，需要开发更鲁棒的搜索方法。

Method: 提出LoRaCompass模型，包含空间感知特征提取器学习RSSI的鲁棒空间表示，使用策略蒸馏损失函数最大化靠近标签的概率，并引入UCB启发的探索函数逐步提高定位置信度。

Result: 在超过80km²的多样化未见环境中验证，LoRaCompass在100米范围内定位成功率超过90%（比现有方法提升40%），搜索路径长度与初始距离呈线性关系。

Conclusion: LoRaCompass通过鲁棒的空间表示学习和置信度增强的探索策略，实现了在未知环境中对LoRa标签的高效可靠定位。

Abstract: The Long-Range (LoRa) protocol, known for its extensive range and low power, has increasingly been adopted in tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) and others at risk of going missing. We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2. It has demonstrated high success rate (>90%) in locating the tag within 100m proximity (a 40% improvement over existing methods) and high efficiency with a search path length (in hops) that scales linearly with the initial distance.

Motivation: 联邦学习方法通常运行预定义的全局轮次，导致在达到最优性能后仍进行不必要的计算，或在模型无法达到有意义性能时继续训练，造成效率低下。

Method: 引入零样本合成验证框架，利用生成式AI监控模型性能并确定早期停止点，自适应地在接近最优轮次时停止训练。

Result: 在多标签胸部X光分类任务上的数值结果显示，该方法可将训练轮次减少高达74%，同时准确率保持在最优值的1%以内。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效节省计算资源并支持快速超参数调整，解决了联邦学习中训练效率低下的问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL methods typically run for a predefined number of global rounds, often leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier. In addition, training may continue even when the model fails to achieve meaningful performance. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points. Our approach adaptively stops training near the optimal round, thereby conserving computational resources and enabling rapid hyperparameter adjustments. Numerical results on multi-label chest X-ray classification demonstrate that our method reduces training rounds by up to 74% while maintaining accuracy within 1% of the optimal.

Conclusion: HealSplit是首个专门为Split Federated Learning设计的统一防御框架，能有效防御多种复杂的数据投毒攻击，显著提升了SFL系统的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) is an emerging paradigm for privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.

Conclusion: 基于EHR的预测建模具有支持更精确和可扩展的早期检测策略的临床潜力，显著优于当前筛查指南中使用的传统风险因素。

Abstract: Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs), which employ neural networks to map atomic structures to system energies, effectively combine the high accuracy of first-principles calculation with the computational efficiency of empirical force fields. They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在边缘设备内存限制下，使用内存高效零阶优化（MeZO）进行设备端微调的方法。与传统反向传播相比，MeZO通过仅使用前向评估来估计梯度，无需存储中间激活或优化器状态，从而支持部署更大的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘AI系统需要在严格内存约束下适应不同任务。传统反向传播训练需要存储层激活和优化器状态，这在设备内存限制下严重限制了可部署模型的最大尺寸。

Method: 使用内存高效零阶优化（MeZO）方法，仅通过前向评估来估计梯度，无需存储中间激活或优化器状态。首先提供BP和MeZO训练下可容纳模型尺寸的理论估计，然后进行数值验证。

Result: MeZO在设备内存约束下表现出精度优势，前提是有足够的微调时间。该方法能够显著增大在芯片内存中可容纳的模型尺寸，尽管可能需要更长的微调时间。

Conclusion: MeZO通过消除存储中间激活和优化器状态的需求，有效缓解了边缘设备内存瓶颈，使得在内存受限环境下能够部署更大规模的模型进行设备端微调。

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning is a critical capability for edge AI systems, which must support adaptation to different agentic tasks under stringent memory constraints. Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 所提出的深度学习方案能够有效设计任务导向彩虹波束，在单次下行传输中实现高精度用户定位，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Phase-time arrays, which integrate phase shifters (PSs) and true-time delays (TTDs), have emerged as a cost-effective architecture for generating frequency-dependent rainbow beams in wideband sensing and localization. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based scheme that simultaneously designs the rainbow beams and estimates user positions. Treating the PS and TTD coefficients as trainable variables allows the network to synthesize task-oriented beams that maximize localization accuracy. A lightweight fully connected module then recovers the user's angle-range coordinates from its feedback of the maximum quantized received power and its corresponding subcarrier index after a single downlink transmission. Compared with existing analytical and learning-based schemes, the proposed method reduces overhead by an order of magnitude and delivers consistently lower two-dimensional positioning error.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用多校准方法来处理加权图中基于不完美权重预测的最佳匹配问题，通过构造多校准预测器来补偿预测误差，使基于该预测器的匹配决策能够与原始预测器上的最佳决策规则竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在加权图的最佳匹配问题中，如果只能访问基于上下文的权重预测，而预测器不完美时，标准的基于预测权重的最优匹配规则可能表现不佳。需要一种方法来补偿预测误差，使决策规则能够适应不完美的预测器。

Method: 提出多校准方法，要求预测器在受保护上下文集合的每个元素上都是无偏的。给定匹配算法类$\mathcal C$和任意边权重预测器$γ$，构造一个特定的多校准预测器$\hat γ$。

Result: 基于$\hat γ$输出的最佳匹配能够与在原始预测器$γ$上应用$\mathcal C$类中最佳决策规则的表现相竞争。

Conclusion: 多校准方法能够有效处理不完美预测器带来的问题，通过构造多校准预测器来提升匹配决策的性能，并提供了样本复杂度界限作为理论支撑。

Abstract: Consider the problem of finding the best matching in a weighted graph where we only have access to predictions of the actual stochastic weights, based on an underlying context. If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.
  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\mathcal C$ and any predictor $γ$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\hat γ$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\hat γ$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $γ$. We complement this result by providing sample complexity bounds.

Abstract: We demonstrate a practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems through two applications: admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping. First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching模型虽然具有高效的无模拟训练和确定性采样优势，但其实际部署受到高精度参数需求的挑战，需要有效的量化方法来压缩模型。

Method: 采用基于最优传输的后训练量化方法，最小化量化权重与原始权重之间的2-Wasserstein距离，并与均匀、分段和对数量化方案进行系统比较。

Result: 在五个不同复杂度的基准数据集上的实验表明，基于最优传输的量化在2-3比特/参数下仍能保持视觉生成质量和潜在空间稳定性，而其他方法在此精度下失效。

Conclusion: 基于最优传输的量化是压缩Flow Matching生成模型的一种原则性有效方法，适用于边缘和嵌入式AI应用。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) generative models offer efficient simulation-free training and deterministic sampling, but their practical deployment is challenged by high-precision parameter requirements. We adapt optimal transport (OT)-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and systematically compare its effectiveness against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications.

Conclusion: RETROFIT能够有效缓解遗忘问题同时保持适应性，为数据敏感环境下的安全分析提供了一种可行的持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: Modern security analytics are increasingly powered by deep learning models, but their performance often degrades as threat landscapes evolve and data representations shift. While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.
  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，DiffPro实现了高达6.25倍的模型压缩、50%的时间步减少和2.8倍的推理加速，Delta FID <= 10。

Conclusion: DiffPro将步骤减少和精度规划统一为一个可部署的预算计划，实现了实时节能的扩散推理。

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high quality images but inference is costly due to many denoising steps and heavy matrix operations. We present DiffPro, a post-training, hardware-faithful framework that works with the exact integer kernels used in deployment and jointly tunes timesteps and per-layer precision in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to reduce latency and memory without any training. DiffPro combines three parts: a manifold-aware sensitivity metric to allocate weight bits, dynamic activation quantization to stabilize activations across timesteps, and a budgeted timestep selector guided by teacher-student drift. In experiments DiffPro achieves up to 6.25x model compression, fifty percent fewer timesteps, and 2.8x faster inference with Delta FID <= 10 on standard benchmarks, demonstrating practical efficiency gains. DiffPro unifies step reduction and precision planning into a single budgeted deployable plan for real-time energy-aware diffusion inference.

Conclusion: FairReweighing算法为回归任务中的公平性问题提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在处理连续敏感属性方面表现出色。

Abstract: There has been a prevalence of applying AI software in both high-stakes public-sector and industrial contexts. However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了多步预测中递归策略和直接策略的传统偏见-方差权衡观点，通过理论分析发现非线性模型中递归策略可能同时具有更低偏差和更高方差，并通过实验验证了这一发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为递归策略具有高偏差低方差，直接策略具有低偏差高方差，但作者认为这种简单规则可能不准确，需要从理论角度重新分析多步预测误差的分解。

Method: 通过将多步预测误差分解为不可约噪声、结构近似差距和估计方差三个部分，对线性预测器和非线性预测器进行理论分析，并使用多层感知机在ETTm1数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 对于线性预测器，结构差距恒为零；对于非线性预测器，递归组合可以增加模型表达能力，结构差距取决于模型和数据。递归策略的估计方差可以表示为单步方差乘以基于雅可比矩阵的放大因子。

Conclusion: 研究结果为选择递归和直接策略提供了实用指导，应基于模型非线性和噪声特性而非传统偏见-方差直觉来做出选择。

Abstract: Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.

Abstract: We present a pure machine learning process for synthesizing radar spectrograms from Motion-Capture (MoCap) data. We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.
  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars. It also suggests the ability to augment scarce radar datasets using more abundant MoCap data for training higher-level applications. Finally, it requires far less computation than physics-based methods for generating radar data.

Conclusion: 提出的分箱方法和评估指标能更可靠地评估共形预测的自适应性，新的自适应预测集算法在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Conformal prediction constructs a set of labels instead of a single point prediction, while providing a probabilistic coverage guarantee. Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.

Conclusion: FarSkip-Collective方法能够有效解决MoEs分布式运行中的通信阻塞问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Blocking communication presents a major hurdle in running MoEs efficiently in distributed settings. To address this, we present FarSkip-Collective which modifies the architecture of modern models to enable overlapping of their computation with communication. Our approach modifies the architecture to skip connections in the model and it is unclear a priori whether the modified model architecture can remain as capable, especially for large state-of-the-art models and while modifying all of the model layers. We answer this question in the affirmative and fully convert a series of state-of-the-art models varying from 16B to 109B parameters to enable overlapping of their communication while achieving accuracy on par with their original open-source releases. For example, we convert Llama 4 Scout (109B) via self-distillation and achieve average accuracy within 1% of its instruction tuned release averaged across a wide range of downstream evaluations. In addition to demonstrating retained accuracy of the large modified models, we realize the benefits of FarSkip-Collective through optimized implementations that explicitly overlap communication with computation, accelerating both training and inference in existing frameworks.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, but it frequently fails to provide fair representation for various marginalized communities defined by multiple protected attributes -- a shortcoming often caused by biases in the training data. As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.
  In this work, we generalize the study of the \emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].
  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al. [AISTATS'20] and Ahmadi et al. [2020]. Additionally, we are the first to provide approximation algorithms for the \emph{fair consensus clustering} problem involving multiple (more than two) groups, thus addressing another open direction highlighted by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].

Abstract: In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.

Abstract: Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) (Lu et al., 2025) is a promising building block for efficiently processing long contexts in LLMs by enabling queries to sparsely attend to a small subset of key-value blocks, drastically reducing computational cost. However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.
