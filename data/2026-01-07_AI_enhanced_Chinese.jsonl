Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses data limitations but lacks transparency in predictions. Active learning (AL) methods optimize data acquisition but overlook interpretability of acquired samples. We propose a dual-framework solution: Expert-Guided Explainable Few-Shot Learning (EGxFSL) and Explainability-Guided AL (xGAL). EGxFSL integrates radiologist-defined regions-of-interest as spatial supervision via Grad-CAM-based Dice loss, jointly optimized with prototypical classification for interpretable few-shot learning. xGAL introduces iterative sample acquisition prioritizing both predictive uncertainty and attention misalignment, creating a closed-loop framework where explainability guides training and sample selection synergistically. On the BraTS (MRI), VinDr-CXR (chest X-ray), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-ray) datasets, we achieve accuracies of 92\\%, 76\\%, and 62\\%, respectively, consistently outperforming non-guided baselines across all datasets. Under severe data constraints, xGAL achieves 76\\% accuracy with only 680 samples versus 57\\% for random sampling. Grad-CAM visualizations demonstrate guided models focus on diagnostically relevant regions, with generalization validated on breast ultrasound confirming cross-modality applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faEGxFSL\u548cxGAL\u53cc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9884\u6d4b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u83b7\u53d6\u6837\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a1) EGxFSL\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7Grad-CAM-based Dice\u635f\u5931\u6574\u5408\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4e0e\u539f\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b2) xGAL\uff1a\u5f15\u5165\u8fed\u4ee3\u6837\u672c\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728BraTS\uff08MRI\uff09\u3001VinDr-CXR\uff08\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\uff09\u548cSIIM-COVID-19\uff08\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523092%\u300176%\u548c62%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u5f15\u5bfc\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\uff0cxGAL\u4ec5\u7528680\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5c31\u8fbe\u523076%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u4ec5\u4e3a57%\u3002Grad-CAM\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, such paradigm shift introduces critical security vulnerabilities stemming from the ''embodiment gap'', a discord between the LLM's abstract reasoning and the physical, context-dependent nature of robotics. While security for text-based LLMs is an active area of research, existing solutions are often insufficient to address the unique threats for the embodied robotic agents, where malicious outputs manifest not merely as harmful text but as dangerous physical actions. In this work, we present a systematic survey, summarizing the emerging threat landscape and corresponding defense strategies for LLM-controlled robotics. Specifically, we discuss a comprehensive taxonomy of attack vectors, covering topics such as jailbreaking, backdoor attacks, and multi-modal prompt injection. In response, we analyze and categorize a range of defense mechanisms, from formal safety specifications and runtime enforcement to multi-LLM oversight and prompt hardening. Furthermore, we review key datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate the robustness of these embodied systems. By synthesizing current research, this work highlights the urgent need for context-aware security solutions and provides a foundational roadmap for the development of safe, secure, and reliable LLM-controlled robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86LLM\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\"\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u9e3f\u6c9f\"\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\"\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u9e3f\u6c9f\"\u5bfc\u81f4\u6076\u610f\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5371\u9669\u7684\u7269\u7406\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672cLLM\u5b89\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72ec\u7279\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u65b0\u5174\u5a01\u80c1\u683c\u5c40\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u5982\u8d8a\u72f1\u3001\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\uff09\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u3001\u591aLLM\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u5f3a\u5316\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86LLM\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5177\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u9760LLM\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u9e3f\u6c9f\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Traditional physical world models (PWM) focus on quantifiable physical attributes such as space and motion, failing to meet the needs of social intelligence modeling. In contrast, the Mental World Model (MWM), as a structured representation of humans' internal mental states, has become the critical cognitive foundation for embodied agents to achieve natural human-machine collaboration and dynamic social adaptation. However, current MWM research faces significant bottlenecks: such as fragmented conceptual framework with vague boundaries between MWM and PWM, disjointed reasoning mechanisms for the technical pathways and applicable scenarios of different Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning paradigms, and detachment between evaluation and practice.\n  To address these issues, this review systematically synthesizes over 100 authoritative studies to provide a comprehensive overview of MWM research for embodied AI. Its core contributions are threefold: First, it constructs a complete theoretical framework for MWM for the first time. Specifically, it distinguishes the essential differences between MWM and PWMs. Second, it systematically defines the key components of MWM through two paradigms for mental element representation.

They have achieved striking progress, but almost all of this progress lives in virtual spaces. These systems transform embeddings and tokens, yet do not themselves touch the world and rarely admit a physical interpretation. In this work we propose a physical transformer that couples modern transformer style computation with geometric representation and physical dynamics. At the micro level, attention heads, and feed-forward blocks are modeled as interacting spins governed by effective Hamiltonians plus non-Hamiltonian bath terms. At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure. More broadly, the framework suggests a path toward physical AI that unify digital reasoning with physically grounded manifolds, opening a route to more interpretable and potentially unified models of reasoning, control, and interaction with the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406Transformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06Transformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u63a8\u7406", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u865a\u62df\u7b26\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7edf\u4e00", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406Transformer\uff1a\u5fae\u89c2\u5c42\u7528\u6709\u6548\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548c\u524d\u9988\u5757\uff1b\u4e2d\u89c2\u5c42\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5fae\u5206\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6d41\uff1b\u5b8f\u89c2\u5c42\u7ef4\u62a4\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u76f8\u56fe", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u7269\u7406Transformer\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7269\u7406AI\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6d41\u5f62\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6a21\u578b"}}

Although textual explanations are easily understood by humans, ensuring their correctness remains a challenge, and evaluations in state-of-the-art remain limited. We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework. This framework addresses the limitations of an existing method, Autonomous Policy Explanation, and the generated transparent rules can achieve satisfactory performance on certain tasks. This framework also enables a systematic and quantitative evaluation of textual explanations, providing valuable insights for the XRL field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u671f\u671b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u8bc6\u522b\u9891\u7e41\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b3) \u5c06\u6761\u4ef6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u89c4\u5219\uff1b4) \u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7cbe\u70bc\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b5) \u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u8c13\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b6) \u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7535\u4fe1\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u4e3b\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u900f\u660e\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6ee1\u610f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684XRL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose the CoCoT (Collaborative Coross-modal Thought) frame- work, built upon two key innovations: a) Dynamic Multi-Region Grounding to adaptively detect the most relevant image regions based on the question, and b) Relation-Aware Reasoning to enable multi-region collaboration by iteratively align- ing visual cues to form a coherent and logical chain of thought. Through this approach, we construct the CoCoT-70K dataset, comprising 74,691 high-quality samples with multi-region annotations and structured reasoning chains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoCoT significantly enhances complex visual rea- soning, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 15.4% on LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0% on Qwen2-VL across six challenging benchmarks.

Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) \\textit{Semantic Structured Compression}, which applies entropy-aware filtering to distill unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) \\textit{Recursive Memory Consolidation}, an asynchronous process that integrates related units into higher-level abstract representations to reduce redundancy; and (3) \\textit{Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval}, which dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity to construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency.

Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness when handling prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self-attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on hybrid synthetic-real datasets spanning InternData-A1 and Agibot-World, covering over 533M frames.

We formalize these complexities into a new class of problems, dubbed Spatio-Temporal Efficacy-optimized Allocation for Multi-robot systems (STEAM). STEAM builds upon trait-based frameworks that model robots using their capabilities (e.g., payload and speed), but goes beyond the typical binary success-failure model by explicitly modeling the efficacy of allocations as trait-efficacy maps. These maps encode how the aggregated capabilities assigned to a task determine performance. Further, STEAM accommodates spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). To solve STEAM problems, we contribute a novel algorithm named Efficacy-optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (E-ITAGS) that simultaneously optimizes task performance and respects time budgets by interleaving task allocation, scheduling, and path planning. Motivated by the fact that trait-efficacy maps are difficult, if not impossible, to specify, E-ITAGS efficiently learns them using a realizability-aware active learning module. Our approach is realizability-aware since it explicitly accounts for the fact that not all combinations of traits are realizable by the robots available during learning. Further, we derive experimentally-validated bounds on E-ITAGS' suboptimality with respect to efficacy. Detailed numerical simulations and experiments using an emergency response domain demonstrate that E-ITAGS generates allocations of higher efficacy compared to baselines, while respecting resource and spatio-temporal constraints. We also show that our active learning approach is sample efficient and establishes a principled tradeoff between data and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSTEAM\u95ee\u9898\u6846\u67b6\u548cE-ITAGS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u80fd\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u5f02\u6784\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u56e2\u961f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u6210\u529f-\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTEAM\u95ee\u9898\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u80fd\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u5206\u914d\u80fd\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u51b3\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1E-ITAGS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u56fe\u641c\u7d22\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u80fd\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u8be6\u7ec6\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cE-ITAGS\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "STEAM\u6846\u67b6\u548cE-ITAGS\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u80fd\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u56e2\u961f\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution. Our analysis only requires mild and standard curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold. The main ingredients in our analysis are Li-Yau estimate for the log-gradient of heat kernel, and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion of the perturbed heat equation.

In this paper, through extensive experiments, we investigate two key issues that must be addressed to deploy on-device models in real-world services: (i) the selection of on-device models and the resource consumption of each model, and (ii) the capability and potential of on-device models for domain adaptation.

However, it remains unclear how textual information contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent the score-related image contents. This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization. These findings provide insights into how to improve the textual reasoning for BIQA and high-level vision tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u76f2\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c-\u5206\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u76f2\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5982\u4f55\u8d21\u732e\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6587\u672c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4ee3\u8868\u4e0e\u5206\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u89d2\u5ea6\u56de\u7b54\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u73b0\u6709BIQA\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c-\u5206\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3001\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1\uff09\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b2\uff09\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8303\u5f0f\u5bf9BIQA\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\uff1b3\uff09\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08PLCC/SRCC\u5dee\u5f02\u7f29\u5c0f\u52300.02/0.03\uff09\uff1b4\uff09\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u7f29\u5c0f\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5dee\u8ddd\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdbBIQA\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

A key assumption in these works is that the goal region is reachable; an assumption that often fails in practice when environments are disconnected. Motivated by this limitation, we consider known 3D environments comprising objects, also called blocks, that form distinct navigable support surfaces (planes), and that are either non-movable (e.g., tables) or movable (e.g., boxes). These surfaces may be mutually disconnected due to height differences, holes, or lateral separations. Our focus is on tasks where the robot must reach a goal region residing on an elevated plane that is unreachable. Rather than declaring such tasks infeasible, an effective strategy is to enable the robot to interact with the environment, rearranging movable objects to create new traversable connections; a problem known as Navigation Among Movable Objects (NAMO). Existing NAMO planners typically address 2D environments, where obstacles are pushed aside to clear a path. These methods cannot directly handle the considered 3D setting; in such cases, obstacles must be placed strategically to bridge these physical disconnections. We address this challenge by developing BRiDGE (Block-based Reconfiguration in Disconnected 3D Geometric Environments), a sampling-based planner that incrementally builds trees over robot and object configurations to compute feasible plans specifying which objects to move, where to place them, and in what order, while accounting for a limited number of movable objects. To accelerate planning, we introduce non-uniform sampling strategies. We show that our method is probabilistically complete and we provide extensive numerical and hardware experiments validating its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "BRiDGE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u65ad\u5f00\u8fde\u63a5\u76843D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u521b\u5efa\u53ef\u7a7f\u8d8a\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5047\u8bbe\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u8fbe\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u65ad\u5f00\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u5e38\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u5f53\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u4f4d\u4e8e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u9ad8\u67b6\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5217\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u8d8a\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86BRiDGE\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5757\u7684\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u65ad\u5f00\u8fde\u63a5\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u589e\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u6811\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u901f\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u6307\u5b9a\u79fb\u52a8\u54ea\u4e9b\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u653e\u7f6e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u6982\u7387\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u503c\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BRiDGE\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b33D\u65ad\u5f00\u8fde\u63a5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5217\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5230\u8fbe\u539f\u672c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers. Therefore, the MLLM architecture appears less suitable for medical image diagnostic classification tasks that demand high certainty. We recommend prioritizing vision encoder optimization and careful dataset curation when developing clinically applicable systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u819d\u5173\u8282\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708eX\u5149\u7247\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6bd4\u5b8c\u6574MLLM\u7ba1\u9053\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u75be\u75c5\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u819d\u5173\u8282\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u5f71\u54cd\u5168\u74033-4\u4ebf\u4eba\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66MLLM\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30MLLM\u5728\u8be5\u91cd\u8981\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u64cd\u7eb5\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u5668\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5bf9\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08500\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff085,778\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u819d\u5173\u8282\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5355\u72ec\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574MLLM\u7ba1\u9053\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7ed3\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cLLM\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002MLLM\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u592a\u9002\u5408\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4f18\u5148\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown strong performance, it often fails to adapt to real-world short-term distribution shifts, which arise as different batches of goods arrive sequentially, causing performance drops. We argue that the short-term lookahead information available in modern logistics systems is key to mitigating this issue, especially during distribution shifts. We formulate online 3D-BP with lookahead parcels as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem and adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to solve it. Our framework employs a dynamic exploration prior that automatically balances a learned RL policy and a robust random policy based on the lookahead characteristics. Additionally, we design an auxiliary reward to penalize long-term spatial waste from individual placements. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving over 10\\% gains under distributional shifts, 4\\% average improvement in online deployment, and up to more than 8\\% in the best case--demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u524d\u77bb\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5728\u7ebf3D\u88c5\u7bb1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a2\u7d22\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u7269\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9762\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\u7684\u88c5\u7bb1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf3D\u88c5\u7bb1\u5728\u7269\u6d41\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u8d27\u7269\u6279\u6b21\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u7269\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u524d\u77bb\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e26\u6709\u524d\u77bb\u5305\u88f9\u7684\u5728\u7ebf3D\u88c5\u7bb1\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u63a2\u7d22\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u5e73\u8861\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684RL\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u968f\u673a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u8f85\u52a9\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u60e9\u7f5a\u5355\u4e2a\u653e\u7f6e\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc710%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6539\u8fdb4%\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8fc78%\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u524d\u77bb\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf3D\u88c5\u7bb1\u5728\u7269\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

VSA, also known as Hyperdimensional Computing, is a computing paradigm that represents and processes information using high-dimensional vectors. While the first version of hdlib established a robust foundation for creating and manipulating these vectors, this update addresses the growing need for more advanced, data-driven modeling within the VSA framework. Here, we present four extensions: significant enhancements to the existing supervised classification model also enabling feature selection, and a new regression model for predicting continuous variables, a clustering model for unsupervised learning, and a graph-based learning model. Furthermore, we propose the first implementation ever of Quantum Hyperdimensional Computing with quantum-powered arithmetic operations and a new Quantum Machine Learning model for supervised learning. hdlib remains open-source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib under the MIT license, and distributed through the Python Package Index (pip install hdlib) and Conda (conda install -c conda-forge hdlib).

Traditional safety frameworks treat contact as unsafe, restricting robots to collision avoidance and limiting their ability to function in dense, everyday settings. As the number of objects grows, model-based approaches for safe manipulation become computationally intractable; meanwhile, learned methods typically tie safety to the task at hand, making them hard to transfer to new tasks without retraining. In this work we introduce Dense Contact Barrier Functions(DCBF). Our approach bypasses the computational complexity of explicitly modeling multi-object dynamics by instead learning a composable, object-centric function that implicitly captures the safety constraints arising from physical interactions. Trained offline on interactions with a few objects, the learned DCBFcomposes across arbitrary object sets at runtime, producing a single global safety filter that scales linearly and transfers across tasks without retraining. We validate our approach through simulated experiments in dense clutter, demonstrating its ability to enable collision-free navigation and safe, contact-rich interaction in suitable settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDense Contact Barrier Functions(DCBF)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u51fd\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u63a5\u89e6\u4ea4\u4e92", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u63a5\u89e6\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u65e5\u5e38\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Dense Contact Barrier Functions(DCBF)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u6355\u6349\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8de8\u4efb\u610f\u7269\u4f53\u96c6\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668", "result": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92", "conclusion": "DCBF\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u51fd\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898"}}

This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows.

Over a long history, their joint configurations and link length ratios have been determined empirically. In recent years, the development of robotic foundation models has become increasingly active, leading to the continuous proposal of various manipulators to support these models. However, none of these manipulators share exactly the same structure, as the order of joints and the ratio of link lengths differ among robots. Therefore, in order to discuss the optimal structure of a manipulator, we performed multi-objective optimization from the perspectives of end-effector reachability and joint torque.

Recent approaches leverage vision and language foundation models to directly solve dense tasks through multi-view renderings and text queries. While promising, these pipelines require expensive inference over multiple renderings, depend heavily on large language-model (LLM) prompt engineering for captions, and fail to exploit the inherent 3D geometry of shapes. We address this gap by introducing an encoder-only 3D model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds. Our pre-training approach builds on existing data engines that generate part-annotated 3D shapes by pairing multi-view SAM regions with VLM captioning. Using this data, we train a point cloud transformer encoder in two stages: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders such as DINOv2 into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of these patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings through a multi-positive contrastive objective. Our 3D encoder achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference without any test-time multi-view rendering, while significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

As a result, tracking aggressive trajectories accurately could be challenging due to the existence of residual physics during controller synthesis. This paper presents a self-supervised residual learning and trajectory optimization framework to address the aforementioned challenges. At first, unknown dynamic effects on the closed-loop model are learned and treated as residuals of the nominal dynamics, jointly forming a hybrid model. We show that learning with analytic gradients can be achieved using only trajectory-level data while enjoying accurate long-horizon prediction with an arbitrary integration step size. Subsequently, a trajectory optimizer is developed to compute the optimal reference trajectory with the residual physics along it minimized. It ends up with trajectories that are friendly to the following control level. The agile flight of quadrotors illustrates that by utilizing the hybrid dynamics, the proposed optimizer outputs aggressive motions that can be precisely tracked.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u654f\u6377\u98de\u884c\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ea\u80fd\u88ab\u6709\u9650\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u6b8b\u4f59\u7269\u7406\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218", "method": "1) \u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a\u5c06\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540d\u4e49\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\u4ec5\u9700\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d1\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6b8b\u4f59\u7269\u7406\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u654f\u6377\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6b8b\u4f59\u7269\u7406\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a"}}

The chapter provides three contributions: (1) a synthesis of how LLM capabilities extend toward agency through reasoning-action-reflection loops; (2) an integrative framework describing core components perception, memory, planning, and tool execution that bridge LLMs with autonomous behavior; (3) a critical assessment of applications and persistent challenges in safety, alignment, reliability, and sustainability. Unlike existing surveys, we focus on the architectural transition from language understanding to autonomous action, emphasizing the technical gaps that must be resolved before deployment. We identify critical research priorities, including verifiable planning, scalable multi-agent coordination, persistent memory architectures, and governance frameworks.

Yet existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture this multimodal reasoning and are largely not open-ended, given the difficulty of evaluating free-form answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark, MovieRecapsQA created using movie recap videos--a distinctive type of YouTube content that summarizes a film by presenting its key events through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Using the recap summary, we generate $\\approx 8.2$ K question-answer (QA) pairs (aligned with movie-subtitles) and provide the necessary \"facts\" needed to verify an answer in a reference-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context of the input (video and/or text); which we use for evaluation. Our benchmark provides videos of multiple lengths (i.e., recap-segments, movie-segments) and categorizations of questions (by modality and type) to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using our benchmark and observe that: 1) visual-only questions remain the most challenging; 2) models default to textual inputs whenever available; 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is still difficult for all models; and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "MovieRecapsQA\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u5f71\u89e3\u8bf4\u89c6\u9891\u521b\u5efa\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ea68.2K\u4e2aQA\u5bf9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5f71\uff09\u6240\u9700\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u4e0d\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u7b54\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528YouTube\u7535\u5f71\u89e3\u8bf4\u89c6\u9891\u521b\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8bf4\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u7ea68.2K\u4e2a\u4e0e\u7535\u5f71\u5b57\u5e55\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684QA\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b54\u6848\u6240\u9700\u7684\"\u4e8b\u5b9e\"\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f307\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff1b3\uff09\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\u4ecd\u7136\u56f0\u96be\uff1b4\uff09\u4e13\u6709\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "MovieRecapsQA\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709VideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing meta-learning-based approaches require a shared representation of environmental structures, which lack flexibility for realistic non-structural disturbances. Besides, representation error and the distribution shifts can lead to heavy degradation in prediction accuracy. This work presents a generalizable disturbance estimation framework that builds on meta-learning and feedback-calibrated online adaptation. By extracting features from a finite time window of past observations, a unified representation that effectively captures general non-structural disturbances can be learned without predefined structural assumptions. The online adaptation process is subsequently calibrated by a state-feedback mechanism to attenuate the learning residual originating from the representation and generalizability limitations. Theoretical analysis shows that simultaneous convergence of both the online learning error and the disturbance estimation error can be achieved. Through the unified meta-representation, our framework effectively estimates multiple rapidly changing disturbances, as demonstrated by quadrotor flight experiments.

This work presents a novel multi-modal EPW control system designed to prioritize patient needs while allowing seamless switching between control modes. Four complementary interfaces, namely joystick, speech, hand gesture, and electrooculography (EOG), are integrated with a continuous vital sign monitoring framework measuring heart rate variability, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and skin temperature. This combination enables greater patient independence while allowing caregivers to maintain real-time supervision and early intervention capability.\n  Two-point calibration of the biophysical sensors against clinical reference devices resulted in root mean square errors of at most 2 bpm for heart rate, 0.5 degree Celsius for skin temperature, and 1 percent for SpO2. Experimental evaluation involved twenty participants with mobility impairments executing a total of 500 indoor navigation commands. The achieved command recognition accuracies were 99 percent for joystick control, 97 percent plus or minus 2 percent for speech, and 95 percent plus or minus 3 percent for hand gesture, with an average closed-loop latency of 20 plus or minus 0.5 milliseconds. Caregivers receive real-time alerts through an Android application following encrypted cloud transmission of physiological data. By integrating multi-modal mobility control with cloud-enabled health monitoring and reporting latency and energy budgets, the proposed prototype addresses key challenges in assistive robotics, contributes toward compliance with ISO 7176-31 and IEC 80601-2-78 safety standards, and establishes a foundation for future adaptive machine learning enhancements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u7406\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u8f6e\u6905\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u60a3\u8005\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u8ba9\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u808c\u840e\u7f29\u4fa7\u7d22\u786c\u5316\u75c7\u3001\u4e2d\u98ce\u540e\u504f\u762b\u3001\u75f4\u5446\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u52a8\u969c\u788d\u7b49\u60a3\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u8f6e\u6905\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u60a3\u8005\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u76d1\u7763\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u56db\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\uff08\u64cd\u7eb5\u6746\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u624b\u52bf\u3001\u773c\u7535\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u76d1\u6d4b\uff08\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u8840\u6c27\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\u3001\u76ae\u80a4\u6e29\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u70b9\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e91\u4f20\u8f93\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8b66\u62a5\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff1a\u5fc3\u7387\u22642bpm\uff0c\u76ae\u80a4\u6e29\u5ea6\u22640.5\u00b0C\uff0c\u8840\u6c27\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\u22641%\uff1b20\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6267\u884c500\u6761\u5ba4\u5185\u5bfc\u822a\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1a\u64cd\u7eb5\u674699%\uff0c\u8bed\u97f397%\u00b12%\uff0c\u624b\u52bf95%\u00b13%\uff1b\u5e73\u5747\u95ed\u73af\u5ef6\u8fdf20\u00b10.5\u6beb\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7b26\u5408ISO 7176-31\u548cIEC 80601-2-78\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way.", "AI": {"tldr": "HAL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u6216\u5e7f\u6cdb\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50", "method": "\u4ece\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cHAL\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u5730\u88ab\u611f\u77e5\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "HAL\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8f6f\u6027\u3001\u5b9a\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u4ee5\u524d\u8d85\u51fa\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u56f4\uff09\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50"}}

Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing. To our knowledge, DreamLoop is the first method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls. We demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamLoop\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u7167\u7247\u751f\u6210\u7535\u5f71\u5faa\u73af\u56fe\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u7535\u5f71\u5faa\u73af\u56fe\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u6865\u63a5\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u6280\u672f\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u4f4e\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4e14\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u590d\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u72ed\u7a84\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u6c34\u548c\u70df\u96fe\uff09\u4e2d\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7535\u5f71\u5faa\u73af\u56fe\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u7f1d\u3001\u53d7\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u6865\u63a5\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u5e27\u548c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5e27\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u65e0\u7f1d\u5faa\u73af\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u6301\u9759\u6001\u80cc\u666f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fd0\u52a8\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u52a8\u753b\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "DreamLoop\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7535\u5f71\u5faa\u73af\u56fe\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7075\u6d3b\u76f4\u89c2\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7535\u5f71\u5faa\u73af\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamLoop\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u7167\u7247\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u7535\u5f71\u5faa\u73af\u56fe\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u827a\u672f\u5f62\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u521b\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization.

We close this gap with a practical sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) framework that utilizes dense tactile feedback combined with joint torque sensing to explicitly regulate physical interactions. To enable effective sim-to-real transfer, we introduce (i) a computationally fast tactile simulation that computes distances between dense virtual tactile units and the object via parallel forward kinematics, providing high-rate, high-resolution touch signals needed by RL; (ii) a current-to-torque calibration that eliminates the need for torque sensors on dexterous hands by mapping motor current to joint torque; and (iii) actuator dynamics modeling to bridge the actuation gaps with randomization of non-ideal effects such as backlash, torque-speed saturation. Using an asymmetric actor-critic PPO pipeline trained entirely in simulation, our policies deploy directly to a five-finger hand. The resulting policies demonstrated two essential skills: (1) command-based, controllable grasp force tracking, and (2) reorientation of objects in the hand, both of which were robustly executed without fine-tuning on the robot. By combining tactile and torque in the observation space with effective sensing/actuation modeling, our system provides a practical solution to achieve reliable dexterous manipulation.

Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u7684RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8bc4\u5206\u9009\u62e9\u8bad\u7ec3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u65e2\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u4e5f\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u8c03\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u4e2d\u7b49\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5f80\u5f80\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u96be\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\u3001\u8f85\u52a9\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u56de\u653e\u548cGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5806\u57fa\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5b9a\u671f\u91cd\u6d4b\u5df2\u89e3\u51b3/\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u9965\u997f\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u65e2\u975e\u6301\u7eed\u89e3\u51b3\u4e5f\u975e\u6301\u7eed\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u8d21\u732e\u8f83\u5c11\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u96be\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u3002"}}

However, state-of-the-art Deep RL (DRL) algorithms typically require large training datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks. We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons. We empirically validate our methodology on challenging variants of gridworld environments, both in the fully observable and partially observable setting.

However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation.

We introduce a soft-rigid co-design framework that leverages non-Newtonian fluid-based soft responsive materials to enhance humanoid safety. The material remains compliant during normal interaction but rapidly stiffens under impact, absorbing and dissipating fall-induced forces. Physics-based simulations guide protector placement and thickness and enable learning of active fall policies. Applied to a 42 kg life-size humanoid, the protector markedly reduces peak impact and allows repeated falls without hardware damage, including drops from 3 m and tumbles down long staircases.

GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation.

However, existing research on MAD suffers from two fundamental limitations: evaluations are conducted under fragmented and inconsistent settings, hindering fair comparison, and are largely restricted to single-modality scenarios that rely on textual inputs only. To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs. Extensive experiments yield systematic insights into the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD across text-only and multimodal scenarios.

With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content.

Conventional optimization-based controllers can enforce physical constraints, but they struggle to produce feasible solutions quickly when many obstacles are present. Diffusion models can generate diverse trajectories around obstacles, yet prior approaches lacked a general and efficient way to condition them on scene structure. In this paper, we show that combining diffusion-based warm-starting conditioned with a latent object-centric representation of the scene and with a collision-aware model predictive controller (MPC) yields reliable and efficient motion generation under strict time limits. Our approach conditions a diffusion transformer on the system state, task, and surroundings, using an object-centric slot attention mechanism to provide a compact obstacle representation suitable for control. The sampled trajectories are refined by an optimal control problem that enforces rigid-body dynamics and signed-distance collision constraints, producing feasible motions in real time.

Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAFS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u5e76\u884c\u5206\u6790\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5f3a\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u6216\u6d88\u9664\u5197\u4f59\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5355\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f46\u6355\u6349\u591a\u7ea7\u4f9d\u8d56\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u654f\u611f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u5c11\u80fd\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "MAFS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u5e76\u884c\u68c0\u67e5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u5757\u6574\u5408\u5404\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u51b2\u7a81\u5e76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5065\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u540d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u764c\u75c7\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cMAFS\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MAFS\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fdd\u7559\u4fe1\u606f\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

Recent research has advanced this topic significantly; however, many existing approaches remain inefficient due to their reliance on heavy foundation models. To address this limitation, we propose LOST-3DSG, a lightweight open-vocabulary 3D scene graph designed to track dynamic objects in real-world environments. Our method adopts a semantic approach to entity tracking based on word2vec and sentence embeddings, enabling an open-vocabulary representation while avoiding the necessity of storing dense CLIP visual features. As a result, LOST-3DSG achieves superior performance compared to approaches that rely on high-dimensional visual embeddings.

While recent approaches including ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine improve reasoning through iterative refinement and reflection, they often lack structured exploration of alternative solution paths and persistent learning across problems. We propose ReTreVal (Reasoning Tree with Validation), a hybrid framework that integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration, self-refinement, LLM-based critique scoring, and reflexion memory to enable bounded and validated multi-step reasoning. ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths. We evaluate ReTreVal against ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B as the underlying LLM, and demonstrate that ReTreVal consistently outperforms existing methods through its combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReTreVal\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u6811\u72b6\u601d\u7ef4\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u7cbe\u70bc\u3001LLM\u6279\u5224\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684ReAct\u3001Reflexion\u548cSelf-Refine\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u66ff\u4ee3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u8de8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "ReTreVal\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u6811\u72b6\u601d\u7ef4\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u7cbe\u70bc\u3001LLM\u6279\u5224\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u5b83\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6811\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u90fd\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u5224\u548c\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u7531\u660e\u786e\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u9988\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u53cc\u91cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u6301\u4e45\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u53cd\u601d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u95ee\u9898\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6279\u5224\u7684\u526a\u679d\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\u53ea\u4fdd\u7559\u524dk\u4e2a\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528Qwen 2.5 7B\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840LLM\uff0c\u5728500\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30ReTreVal\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aReTreVal\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u6279\u5224\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u8de8\u95ee\u9898\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8eReAct\u3001Reflexion\u548cSelf-Refine\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ReTreVal\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u6279\u5224\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u8de8\u95ee\u9898\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

In this study, we present a systematic analysis of logical reasoning under controlled increases in logical complexity, and reveal a previously unrecognized phenomenon, which we term Logical Phase Transitions: rather than degrading smoothly, logical reasoning performance remains stable within a regime but collapses abruptly beyond a critical logical depth, mirroring physical phase transitions such as water freezing beyond a critical temperature threshold. Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

However, due to the extremely limited pixel information and significant variations in object density, mainstream Transformer-based detectors often suffer from slow convergence and inaccurate query-object matching. To address these challenges, we propose D$^3$R-DETR, a novel DETR-based detector with Dual-Domain Density Refinement. By fusing spatial and frequency domain information, our method refines low-level feature maps and utilizes their rich details to predict more accurate object density map, thereby guiding the model to precisely localize tiny objects. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD-v2 dataset demonstrate that D$^3$R-DETR outperforms existing state-of-the-art detectors for tiny object detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "D\u00b3R-DETR\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDETR\u7684\u53cc\u57df\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ec6\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u4fe1\u606f\u6781\u5176\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u76ee\u6807\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684Transformer-based\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u67e5\u8be2-\u76ee\u6807\u5339\u914d\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faD\u00b3R-DETR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDETR\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u57df\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u7ec6\u5316\u4f4e\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bc6\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5fae\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728AI-TOD-v2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cD\u00b3R-DETR\u5728\u5fae\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "D\u00b3R-DETR\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u57df\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ec6\u5316\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5fae\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This challenge becomes more pronounced in real-world settings, where viewpoint variability is unavoidable and can significantly disrupt policy performance. Existing methods typically learn invariance from multi-view observations at the scene level, but such approaches rely on visual appearance and fail to incorporate the physical dynamics essential for robust generalization. We propose View-Invariant Latent Action (VILA), which models a latent action capturing transition patterns across trajectories to learn view-invariant representations grounded in physical dynamics. VILA aligns these latent actions across viewpoints using an action-guided objective based on ground-truth action sequences.

Extended version of our ICCV 2025 highlight paper [arXiv:2503.07940]. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.07940", "summary": "Some deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, often requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy. We evaluate on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 12 datasets spanning object-scale, indoor, and outdoor scenes, including cross-sensor registration between heterogeneous LiDAR configurations. Results demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively without manual tuning or prior knowledge of test domains.

The core limitation lies in the prevalent ``track-then-descend'' paradigm, which treats the platform as a passive target and forces the quadcopter to perform complex, sequential maneuvers. This paper challenges that paradigm by introducing a bi-directional cooperative landing framework that redefines the roles of the vehicle and the platform. The essential innovation is transforming the problem from a single-agent tracking challenge into a coupled system optimization. Our key insight is that the mobile platform is not merely a target, but an active agent in the landing process. It proactively tilts its surface to create an optimal, stable terminal attitude for the approaching quadcopter. This active cooperation fundamentally breaks the sequential model by parallelizing the alignment and descent phases. Concurrently, the quadcopter's planning pipeline focuses on generating a time-optimal and dynamically feasible trajectory that minimizes energy consumption. This bi-directional coordination allows the system to execute the recovery in an agile manner, characterized by aggressive trajectory tracking and rapid state synchronization within transient windows. The framework's effectiveness, validated in dynamic scenarios, significantly improves the efficiency, precision, and robustness of autonomous quadrotor recovery in complex and time-constrained missions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u540c\u964d\u843d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3b\u52a8\u503e\u659c\u8868\u9762\u4e3a\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u521b\u9020\u6700\u4f73\u7740\u9646\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4e0b\u964d\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u52a8\u6001\u964d\u843d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\"\u8ddf\u8e2a-\u4e0b\u964d\"\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u89c6\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u673a\u52a8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u540c\u964d\u843d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u4ece\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6311\u6218\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3b\u52a8\u503e\u659c\u8868\u9762\u4e3a\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u521b\u9020\u6700\u4f73\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ec8\u7aef\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u89c4\u5212\u7ba1\u9053\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u56de\u6536\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u654f\u6377\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u72b6\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u987a\u5e8f\u964d\u843d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u52a8\u6001\u964d\u843d\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

We therefore propose the rationale-grounded in-context learning for time series reasoning, where rationales work as guiding reasoning units rather than post-hoc explanations, and develop the RationaleTS method. Specifically, we firstly induce label-conditioned rationales, composed of reasoning paths from observable evidence to the potential outcomes.

Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy.

Project page: https://github.com/House-yuyu/ClearAIR", "summary": "All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has advanced significantly, offering promising solutions for complex real-world degradations. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration.

Code:https://github.com/ChangPtR/AbdMLLM", "summary": "Visual abductive reasoning (VAR) is a challenging task that requires AI systems to infer the most likely explanation for incomplete visual observations. While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking. It conditions a text-to-image diffusion model on both the input video and the REASONER's output embeddings to \"imagine\" plausible visual scenes that correspond to verbal explanation, thereby enriching MLLMs' contextual grounding. The two components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on standard VAR benchmarks show that AbductiveMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAbductiveMLLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u8a00\u8bed\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u53cc\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4ecd\u8fdc\u4e0d\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u8a00\u8bed\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u53cc\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u7684\u6eaf\u56e0\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAbductiveMLLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aREASONER\uff08\u8a00\u8bed\u57df\uff09\u548cIMAGINER\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\uff09\u3002REASONER\u5148\u7528\u76f2LLM\u63a2\u7d22\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u518d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fee\u526a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5c06\u5269\u4f59\u5047\u8bbe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfcMLLM\u63a8\u7406\u3002IMAGINER\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\"\u60f3\u8c61\"\u4e0e\u8a00\u8bed\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u89c6\u89c9\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAbductiveMLLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u8a00\u8bed\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u53cc\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing post-training approaches for VLA models are typically offline, single-robot, or task-specific, limiting effective on-policy adaptation and scalable learning from real-world interaction. We introduce a Scalable Online Post-training (SOP) system that enables online, distributed, multi-task post-training of generalist VLA models directly in the physical world. SOP tightly couples execution and learning through a closed-loop architecture in which a fleet of robots continuously streams on-policy experience and human intervention signals to a centralized cloud learner, and asynchronously receives updated policies. This design supports prompt on-policy correction, scales experience collection through parallel deployment, and preserves generality during adaptation. SOP is agnostic to the choice of post-training algorithm; we instantiate it with both interactive imitation learning (HG-DAgger) and reinforcement learning (RECAP). Across a range of real-world manipulation tasks including cloth folding, box assembly, and grocery restocking, we show that SOP substantially improves the performance of large pretrained VLA models while maintaining a single shared policy across tasks. Effective post-training can be achieved within hours of real-world interaction, and performance scales near-linearly with the number of robots in the fleet. These results suggest that tightly coupling online learning with fleet-scale deployment is instrumental to enabling efficient, reliable, and scalable post-training of generalist robot policies in the physical world.", "AI": {"tldr": "SOP\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u7528VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ea7\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u91cf\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u3001\u5355\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u652f\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSOP\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8230\u961f\u6301\u7eed\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u4fe1\u53f7\u5230\u4e2d\u592e\u4e91\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u5f02\u6b65\u63a5\u6536\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff08HG-DAgger\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RECAP\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e03\u6599\u6298\u53e0\u3001\u7bb1\u5b50\u7ec4\u88c5\u3001\u6742\u8d27\u8865\u8d27\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSOP\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5171\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u91cf\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8230\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

To address this, a progressive Earth vision-language understanding and generation framework is proposed, including a multi-task dataset (EarthVLSet) and a semantic-guided network (EarthVLNet). Focusing on city planning applications, EarthVLSet includes 10.9k sub-meter resolution remote sensing images, land-cover masks, and 761.5k textual pairs involving both multiple-choice and open-ended visual question answering (VQA) tasks. In an object-centric way, EarthVLNet is proposed to progressively achieve semantic segmentation, relational reasoning, and comprehensive understanding. The first stage involves land-cover segmentation to generate object semantics for VQA guidance. Guided by pixel-wise semantics, the object awareness based large language model (LLM) performs relational reasoning and knowledge summarization to generate the required answers. As for optimization, the numerical difference loss is proposed to dynamically add difference penalties, addressing the various objects' statistics. Three benchmarks, including semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA demonstrated the superiorities of EarthVLNet, yielding three future directions: 1) segmentation features consistently enhance VQA performance even in cross-dataset scenarios; 2) multiple-choice tasks show greater sensitivity to the vision encoder than to the language decoder; and 3) open-ended tasks necessitate advanced vision encoders and language decoders for an optimal performance. We believe this dataset and method will provide a beneficial benchmark that connects ''image-mask-text'', advancing geographical applications for Earth vision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEarthVLNet\u6846\u67b6\u548cEarthVLSet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5730\u7403\u89c6\u89c9\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u8fde\u63a5\"\u56fe\u50cf-\u63a9\u7801-\u6587\u672c\"\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63a8\u8fdb\u5730\u7406\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0fEarthVLNet\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u5272\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u603b\u7ed3\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\u635f\u5931\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002\u914d\u5957\u521b\u5efaEarthVLSet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b10.9k\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c761.5k\u6587\u672c\u5bf9", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3001\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0fVQA\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u5206\u5272\u7279\u5f81\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347VQA\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2) \u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff1b3) \u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u7801\u5668", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\"\u56fe\u50cf-\u63a9\u7801-\u6587\u672c\"\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u76ca\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5730\u7403\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u5730\u7406\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411"}}

However, the nonlinear programs approximating the OCPs are inherently nonconvex due to the coupling between the dynamics and the event timing, and therefore, they are challenging to solve. Most approaches address this challenge by predefining waypoint times or just using nonconvex trajectory optimization, which simplifies the problem but often yields suboptimal solutions. To significantly improve the numerical properties, we propose a formulation with a time-scaling direct multiple shooting scheme that partitions the prediction horizon into segments aligned with characteristic time constraints. Moreover, we develop a fast semidefinite-programming-based convex relaxation that exploits the sparsity pattern of the lifted formulation. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the solution optimality and computational efficiency. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a quadrotor waypoint flight task with constrained open time windows validate the practical applicability of the approach in complex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u76f4\u63a5\u591a\u91cd\u6253\u9776\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u5bfc\u822a\u7b49\uff09\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u5e8f\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u8fd1\u4f3c\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u975e\u51f8\u7684\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u822a\u70b9\u65f6\u95f4\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u51f8\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5f80\u5f80\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u76f4\u63a5\u591a\u91cd\u6253\u9776\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u57df\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6bb5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u5728\u5177\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u5f00\u653e\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u822a\u70b9\u98de\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u76f4\u63a5\u591a\u91cd\u6253\u9776\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents.

Its input style conditions typically include text, style image, and stylized first frame. Each condition has a characteristic advantage: text is more flexible, style image provides a more accurate visual anchor, and stylized first frame makes long-video stylization feasible. However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens.

Existing explainability approaches in robotics typically either focus on individual modules, which can be difficult to query from the perspective of high-level behaviour, or employ monolithic approaches, which do not exploit the modularity of robotic architectures. We present HEXAR (Hierarchical EXplainability Architecture for Robots), a novel framework that provides a plug-in, hierarchical approach to generate explanations about robotic systems. HEXAR consists of specialised component explainers using diverse explanation techniques (e.g., LLM-based reasoning, causal models, feature importance, etc) tailored to specific robot modules, orchestrated by an explainer selector that chooses the most appropriate one for a given query. We implement and evaluate HEXAR on a TIAGo robot performing assistive tasks in a home environment, comparing it against end-to-end and aggregated baseline approaches across 180 scenario-query variations.

Giribet", "Leonardo Colombo"], "title": "Dual-quaternion learning control for autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking with safety guarantees", "comment": null, "summary": "We propose a learning-based trajectory tracking controller for autonomous robotic platforms whose motion can be described kinematically on $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$. The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion.\n  The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller.\n  Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations. These results illustrate the potential of combining geometric modeling and probabilistic learning to achieve robust, data-efficient pose control for autonomous robotic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684SE(3)\u8fd0\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u5076\u56db\u5143\u6570\u6846\u67b6\u548cGP\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u8865\u507f\u672a\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u6267\u884c\u8026\u5408\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u59ff\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5076\u56db\u5143\u6570\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u51e0\u4f55\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8865\u507f\u59ff\u6001\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u521a\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8026\u5408\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7Lyapunov\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u754cGP\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6700\u7ec8\u6709\u754c\u6027\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u6270\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u65f6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6982\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u59ff\u6001\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

We propose a novel approach that adapts any state-of-the-art image-based (depth) estimation model for video processing by integrating a new temporal module - trainable on a single GPU in a few days. Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence. This allows the model to capture global context and inter-frame relationships leading to more accurate and temporally stable depth predictions. Furthermore, we propose a novel inference strategy for processing videos of arbitrary length avoiding the scale misalignment and redundant computations associated with overlapping windows used in other methods.

The study aims to develop a robust regression model that can generalize across domains by training on 60 second labeled sequences of 1 Hz surface drilling data to predict the SSI. The model is tested in wells that are different from those used during training. To fine-tune the model architecture, a grid search approach is employed to optimize key hyperparameters. A comparative analysis of the Adversarial Domain Generalization (ADG), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and baseline models is presented, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of transfer learning (TL) in improving model performance. The ADG and IRM models achieve performance improvements of 10% and 8%, respectively, over the baseline model. Most importantly, severe events are detected 60% of the time, against 20% for the baseline model. Overall, the results indicate that both ADG and IRM models surpass the baseline, with the ADG model exhibiting a slight advantage over the IRM model.

However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism that employs graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, ensuring structural consistency. Furthermore, we propose a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency.

Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios.

In contrast, humans often employ sketch-style reasoning: a concise, goal-directed cognitive process that prioritizes salient information and enables efficient problem-solving. Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy.

We demonstrate RESGA and SAEGA's effectiveness across Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 3 for steering three different personas,sycophancy, hallucination, and myopic reward.

Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF).

We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack.

Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data. However, existing VideoLLMs remain challenging in identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing the generated captions to be not properly grounded. In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video.

We study the problem of constructing a conformal prediction set that is uniformly valid across multiple, heterogeneous distributions, in the sense that no matter which distribution the test point is from, the coverage of the prediction set is guaranteed to exceed a pre-specified level. We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning. In synthetic and real-data experiments, our method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while greatly reducing the set size compared with naively applying max-p aggregation to single-source conformity scores, and can be comparable in size to single-source prediction sets with popular, standard conformity scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u591a\u5206\u5e03\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u6709\u6548\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7max-p\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4efb\u610f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u4e2a\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u81ea\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u5e03\u6216\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u591a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7edf\u4e00\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65e0\u8bba\u6d4b\u8bd5\u70b9\u6765\u81ea\u54ea\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u90fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u9884\u8bbe\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51famax-p\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u591a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684worst-case\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u5e94\u7528max-p\u805a\u5408\u5230\u5355\u6e90\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u5c0f\u53ef\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u884c\u6807\u51c6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u7684\u5355\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u5206\u5e03\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u6982\u5ff5\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization.

The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance.

We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6846\u67b6CMF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u70b9\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5e95\u5c42\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u6027\u522b\uff09\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6539\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f1a\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u5730\u626d\u66f2\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u9ece\u66fc\u51e0\u4f55\uff08\u7531\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u5b9a\u4e49\uff09\u5728\u5bf9\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u6d77\u68ee\u77e9\u9635\u65bd\u52a0\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff08\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b(SCMs)\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CMF\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u654f\u611f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5ea6\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "CMF\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework.

If successful, this approach offers one of the most promising routes for human oversight in AI safety. We conduct an initial stress-test of these claims by replicating their main results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1. While we successfully reproduce basic feature extraction and steering capabilities, our investigation suggests that major caution is warranted regarding the generalizability of these claims. We find that feature steering exhibits substantial fragility, with sensitivity to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context. We observe non-standard activation behavior and demonstrate the difficulty to distinguish thematically similar features from one another. While SAE-based interpretability produces compelling demonstrations in selected cases, current methods often fall short of the systematic reliability required for safety-critical applications. This suggests a necessary shift in focus from prioritizing interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output.

Though deep learning models have excellent fault detection capabilities, almost all methods either are too large and heavy for edge computing devices or involve biased estimation of accuracy due to ineffective learning techniques. We propose a new solar panel fault detection model called HybridSolarNet. It integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We implemented it on the Kaggle Solar Panel Images competition dataset with a tight split-before-augmentation protocol. It avoids leakage in accuracy estimation. We introduced focal loss and cosine annealing. Ablation analysis validates that accuracy boosts due to added benefits from CBAM (+1.53%) and that there are benefits from recognition of classes with imbalanced samples via focal loss. Overall average accuracy on 5-fold stratified cross-validation experiments on the given competition dataset topped 92.37% +/- 0.41 and an F1-score of 0.9226 +/- 0.39 compared to baselines like VGG19, requiring merely 16.3 MB storage, i.e., 32 times less. Its inference speed measured at 54.9 FPS with GPU support makes it a successful candidate for real-time UAV implementation.

Existing KV-cache compression methods rely on rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized compute, hindering scalability and deployment.\n  We propose joint encoding of KV-cache blocks, which fuses similar blocks across requests and input chunks into shared representations while preserving standard cache structure. This alleviates the KV-cache memory bottleneck, supporting high-concurrency serving without specialized hardware. Theoretically, we analyze the rate-distortion tradeoff of fused cache blocks under a Poisson process model. Empirically, our method achieves up to 4.38 $\\times$ KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, outperforming recent structured and adaptive compression baselines. In real LLM serving, joint encoding improves the token throughput by $\\sim$40\\% on a single-machine vLLM benchmark, demonstrating substantial gains in inference throughput.

To this end, we construct VTONQA, the first multi-dimensional quality assessment dataset specifically designed for VTON, which contains 8,132 images generated by 11 representative VTON models, along with 24,396 mean opinion scores (MOSs) across three evaluation dimensions (i.e., clothing fit, body compatibility, and overall quality).

We believe that the VTONQA dataset and corresponding benchmarks will provide a solid foundation for perceptually aligned evaluation, benefiting both the development of quality assessment methods and the advancement of VTON models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\uff08VTON\uff09\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6VTONQA\uff0c\u5305\u542b8,132\u5f20\u753111\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027VTON\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u548c24,396\u4e2a\u5e73\u5747\u610f\u89c1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u670d\u88c5\u5408\u8eab\u5ea6\u3001\u8eab\u4f53\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u670d\u88c5\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u652f\u6301VTON\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaVTONQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b8,132\u5f20\u753111\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027VTON\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6536\u96c624,396\u4e2a\u5e73\u5747\u610f\u89c1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u670d\u88c5\u5408\u8eab\u5ea6\u3001\u8eab\u4f53\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eVTONQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9VTON\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "VTONQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u548cVTON\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches rely on fixed steering policies and static intervention strengths, which limit their robustness across problem instances and often result in over- or under-steering. We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task- specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning.

Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation. Across five challenging benchmarks, our 3B model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and plug-in experiments yield an additional average improvement of $\\mathbf{12.1\\%}$ across different MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6f2b\u753b\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54(CVQA)\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6f2b\u753b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe(CoT)\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(MLLMs)\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316CoT\u751f\u6210\u3001GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e7d\u9ed8\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f2b\u753b\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54(CVQA)\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u53d9\u4e8b\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u5e7d\u9ed8\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe(CoT)\u63d0\u793a\u5728CVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7ea0\u7f20\u3001\u865a\u5047\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6f2b\u753b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u6a21\u5757\u5316CoT\u751f\u6210\uff0c2) \u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c3) \u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u5c0f\u578bMLLMs\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76843B\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u63d2\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540cMLLMs\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u83b7\u5f97\u4e8612.1%\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u6f2b\u753bVQA\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8868\u60c5\u5305\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u793e\u8bba\u6f2b\u753b\u89e3\u8bfb\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfCoT\u5728\u6f2b\u753b\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6f2b\u753b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u7b26\u53f7\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u53d9\u4e8b\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards. By integrating ergonomic structure with transformer-based linguistic reasoning, MyoText advances the feasibility of seamless, wearable neural input for future ubiquitous computing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "MyoText\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u8868\u9762\u808c\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u624b\u6307\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u8868\u9762\u808c\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3a\u89e3\u7801\u808c\u8089\u6d3b\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u662f\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u73b0\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65e0\u952e\u76d8\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u76f4\u63a5\u4ecesEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bc6\u522b\u5b57\u6bcd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4ece\u808c\u8089\u6d3b\u52a8\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7684\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u8f6c\u6362\u8def\u5f84", "method": "MyoText\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528CNN-BiLSTM-Attention\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u591a\u901a\u9053sEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u7c7b\u624b\u6307\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u6253\u5b57\u5148\u9a8c\u63a8\u65ad\u5b57\u6bcd\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u7684T5\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u53e5\u5b50\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6253\u5b57\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784", "result": "\u5728emg2qwerty\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u768430\u540d\u7528\u6237\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cMyoText\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8685.4%\u7684\u624b\u6307\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u30015.4%\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u548c6.5%\u7684\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "MyoText\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4ece\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u4fe1\u53f7\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u9700\u7269\u7406\u952e\u76d8\u7684\u865a\u62df\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u6253\u5b57\u63a5\u53e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u666e\u9002\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e0\u7f1d\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u795e\u7ecf\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027"}}

While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser.

We propose Time-Aware Synthetic Control (TASC), which employs a state-space model with a constant trend while preserving a low-rank structure of the signal. TASC uses the Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother: it first fits a generative time-series model with expectation-maximization and then performs counterfactual inference.

In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models.

SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning. Experiments on active view selection demonstrate that SA-ResGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and view selection robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "SA-ResGS\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u589e\u5f3a\u70b9\u4e91\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u53473D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e3b\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u5bbd\u57fa\u7ebf\u89c6\u56fe\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "1. \u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0e\u5149\u6805\u5316\u5916\u63a8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u589e\u5f3a\u70b9\u4e91\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf93D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548cdropout/\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u91c7\u6837\uff1b3. \u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5747\u5300\u573a\u666f\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSA-ResGS\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SA-ResGS\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u589e\u5f3a\u70b9\u4e91\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u5bbd\u57fa\u7ebf\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0b\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u548cNBV\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Synthetic data can bridge this gap, but existing generators do not jointly achieve behavioral diversity and logical groundedness. Rule-driven simulators rely on hand-crafted workflows and shallow stochasticity, which miss the richness of human behavior. Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware \"nextprompt\" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation. PersonaLedger offers a realistic, privacy preserving resource that supports rigorous evaluation of forecasting and anomaly detection models.

In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -the prompt- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u6bd2\u6027\u3001\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u4ec0\u4e48\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "1. \u5206\u6790\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b4. \u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u653f\u6cbb\u503e\u5411\u3001\u6bd2\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u611f\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b80\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u826f\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u5f15\u53d1\u4e0d\u826f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u805a\u7126\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6ee1\u8db3\u65b0\u5174\u76d1\u7ba1\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u5c06\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur.

While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\\mathsf{TC^0} \\subsetneq \\mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures.

In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, existing MOO methods typically treat all hyperparameters as equally important, overlooking that hyperparameter importance (HPI) can vary significantly depending on the trade-off between objectives. We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization.

Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components. In the final prediction, explicit weights are assigned to each pair of components. Extensive experiments on three single-source benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFSG achieves an average performance improvement of 9.87% over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.08%. Additionally, explainability analysis validates that CFSG effectively integrates multi-granularity structured knowledge and confirms that feature structuralization facilitates the emergence of concept structuralization.", "AI": {"tldr": "CFSG\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u5171\u540c\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ebf\u7d22\u8fc7\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53479.87%\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u7c7b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7c7b\u5185\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5728\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ebf\u7d22\u8fc7\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8ba4\u77e5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5171\u540c\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u6765\u5206\u7c7b\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u672a\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5165\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u5ff5-\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6cdb\u5316\uff08CFSG\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u660e\u786e\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u5171\u540c\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5171\u540c\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5bf9\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5206\u914d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5355\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCFSG\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53479.87%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u57473.08%\u3002\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CFSG\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u8ba4\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "CFSG\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present a large-scale dataset of 129,000+ labeled multivariate time-series sequences from 153 rides by 51 participants under No, Low, and High Time Pressure conditions. Each sequence captures 63 features spanning vehicle kinematics, control inputs, behavioral violations, and environmental context. Our empirical analysis shows High Time Pressure induces 48% higher speeds, 36.4% greater speed variability, 58% more risky turns at intersections, 36% more sudden braking, and 50% higher rear brake forces versus No Time Pressure. To benchmark this dataset, we propose MotoTimePressure, a deep learning model combining convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration, achieving 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, outperforming eight baselines. Since time pressure cannot be directly measured in real time, we demonstrate its utility in collision prediction and threshold determination. Using MTPS-predicted time pressure as features, improves Informer-based collision risk accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%, approaching oracle performance (93.72%).

The proposed architecture consists of three specialised agents: visual agent, language agent and critic agent, which work collaboratively to support structured reasoning by integrating visual cues and narrative context. The framework was systematically evaluated on two cartoon-based VQA datasets: Pororo and Simpsons. Experimental results provide a detailed analysis of how each agent contributes to the final prediction, offering a deeper understanding of LLM-based multi-agent behaviour in cartoon VQA and multimodal inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5361\u901a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u6279\u8bc4\uff09\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5361\u901a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5904\u7406\u5361\u901a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u62bd\u8c61\u5938\u5f20\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5361\u901aVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u548c\u6279\u8bc4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6574\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u4f5c\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728Pororo\u548cSimpsons\u4e24\u4e2a\u5361\u901aVQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9LLM\u57fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5361\u901aVQA\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5361\u901a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5361\u901a\u7279\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5361\u901aVQA\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Develops an axiomatic, operator-agnostic framework for probability-domain knowledge distillation, including bias--variance analysis of sparse students, homotopy-based multi-stage pruning, $O(1/n)$ convergence guarantees, and equivalence classes of probability-domain softening operators. Theoretical analysis only", "summary": "We develop a unified theoretical framework for sparse knowledge distillation based on probability-domain softening operators. While the equivalence $p^{1/T} \\propto \\mathrm{softmax}(z/T)$ is well known, our contribution is an operator-level analytical framework built on this foundation rather than the equivalence itself.\n  The framework comprises four core components: (i) operator-agnostic bias--variance decompositions that characterize when sparse students outperform dense teachers, (ii) a homotopy path formalization of multi-stage pruning in function space explaining why iterative compression succeeds where one-shot pruning fails, (iii) convergence guarantees establishing $O(1/n)$ rates for $n$-stage distillation with explicit parameter dependence, and (iv) equivalence class characterizations identifying distinct probability-domain operators that yield identical student models under capacity constraints.\n  We introduce an axiomatic definition of probability-domain softening operators based on ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, identity, and boundary behavior, and show that multiple non-equivalent operator families satisfy these axioms. All learning-theoretic guarantees are shown to hold uniformly across this operator class, independent of implementation details. These results provide theoretical grounding for black-box teacher distillation, partial-access settings such as top-$k$ truncation and text-only outputs, and privacy-preserving model compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u57df\u8f6f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u540c\u4f26\u8def\u5f84\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3001\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u8868\u5f81\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u7a00\u758f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u65f6\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5bc6\u96c6\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u8bbf\u95ee\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u57df\u8f6f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u71b5\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u3001\u6052\u7b49\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u516c\u7406\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u591a\u4e2a\u975e\u7b49\u4ef7\u7b97\u5b50\u65cf\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7b97\u5b50\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u526a\u679d\u7684\u540c\u4f26\u8def\u5f84\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3001n\u9636\u6bb5\u84b8\u998f\u7684O(1/n)\u6536\u655b\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u540c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6982\u7387\u57df\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u8be5\u7b97\u5b50\u7c7b\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u8bbf\u95ee\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise \"experts\" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench.

Counterfactual Fairness (CF) audits allow the measurement of bias of ML models with a causal framework, yet their conclusions rely on a single causal graph that is rarely known with certainty in real-world scenarios.

CF-GU (i) bootstraps a Causal Discovery algorithm under domain knowledge constraints to produce a bag of plausible Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), (ii) quantifies graph uncertainty with the normalized Shannon entropy, and (iii) provides confidence bounds on CF metrics.

Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unified Thinker\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e13\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406-\u6267\u884c\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u95ed\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982Nano Banana\uff09\u5df2\u5c55\u793a\u5f3a\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUnified Thinker\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u4e13\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u5668\uff08Thinker\uff09\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08Generator\uff09\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u89c4\u5212\u6838\u5fc3\u53ef\u63a5\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUnified Thinker\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ea7\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u63a8\u7406-\u6267\u884c\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing approaches rely on patch-based processing and costly post-processing for instance separation, sacrificing context and efficiency. We introduce LSP-DETR (Local Star Polygon DEtection TRansformer), a fully end-to-end framework that uses a lightweight transformer with linear complexity to process substantially larger images without additional computational cost. Nuclei are represented as star-convex polygons, and a novel radial distance loss function allows the segmentation of overlapping nuclei to emerge naturally, without requiring explicit overlap annotations or handcrafted post-processing. Evaluations on PanNuke and MoNuSeg show strong generalization across tissues and state-of-the-art efficiency, with LSP-DETR being over five times faster than the next-fastest leading method.

Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"epiplexity\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u80fd\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u589e\u52a0\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u987a\u5e8f\u65e0\u5173\u7b49\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\uff08\u9999\u519c\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u67ef\u5c14\u83ab\u54e5\u6d1b\u592b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u770b\u4f3c\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165epiplexity\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u80fd\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u754c\u71b5\uff08\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u9645\u4f30\u8ba1epiplexity\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u521b\u9020\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f3c\u7136\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002epiplexity\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u51fa\u6539\u5584\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "conclusion": "epiplexity\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6216\u8f6c\u6362\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u539f\u5219\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002"}}

However, their inherently multiple step inference process imposes substantial computational overhead, hindering real-world deployment. Accelerating diffusion models is therefore essential, yet determining how to combine multiple model acceleration techniques remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a framework driven by large language models (LLMs) for automated acceleration code generation and evaluation. First, we present DiffBench, a comprehensive benchmark that implements a three stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimization combinations and deployment scenarios. Second, we propose DiffAgent, an agent that generates optimal acceleration strategies and codes for arbitrary diffusion models. DiffAgent employs a closed-loop workflow in which a planning component and a debugging component iteratively refine the output of a code generation component, while a genetic algorithm extracts performance feedback from the execution environment to guide subsequent code refinements. We provide a detailed explanation of the DiffBench construction and the design principles underlying DiffAgent.

Recently, unsupervised learning of data group structure with deep learning methods has gained popularity. TURTLE, a state of the art deep clustering algorithm, uncovers data labeling without supervision by alternating label and hyperplane updates, maximizing the hyperplane margin, in a similar fashion to support vector machines (SVMs). However, TURTLE assumes clusters are balanced; when data is imbalanced, it yields non-ideal hyperplanes that cause higher clustering error.

Additionally, by introducing sparse logits in the labeling process, PET-TURTLE optimizes a simpler search space that in turn improves accuracy for balanced datasets.

Although existing grounding techniques improve overall performance, they often fail to establish a true anatomical correspondence, resulting in incorrect anatomical understanding in the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by the radiological workflow, AnatomiX adopts a two stage approach: first, it identifies anatomical structures and extracts their features, and then leverages a large language model to perform diverse downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, report generation, visual question answering, and image understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG.

We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized audiovisual content in a unified manner. LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability.

Such representations restrict their scalability to arbitrary output resolutions and hinder the geometric detail recovery. This paper introduces InfiniDepth, which represents depth as neural implicit fields. Through a simple yet effective local implicit decoder, we can query depth at continuous 2D coordinates, enabling arbitrary-resolution and fine-grained depth estimation. To better assess our method's capabilities, we curate a high-quality 4K synthetic benchmark from five different games, spanning diverse scenes with rich geometric and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks across relative and metric depth estimation tasks, particularly excelling in fine-detail regions.

Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.
