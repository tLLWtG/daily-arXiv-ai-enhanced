### [1] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI是一个开源标注软件，填补了动物行为分析中交互检测的空白，支持在视频数据中标注行为和交互，为计算机视觉模型训练提供结构化输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源标注工具要么只支持行为标注而不定位个体，要么只定位个体而不捕捉交互，无法满足理解社交和个体化动物行为的需求。

Method: 开发SILVI软件，集成行为标注和交互检测功能，直接在视频数据中标注行为和交互。

Result: SILVI能够生成适合训练和验证计算机视觉模型的结构化输出，连接行为生态学和计算机视觉领域。

Conclusion: SILVI促进了细粒度行为分析自动化方法的发展，虽然主要用于动物行为分析，但也可广泛应用于需要提取动态场景图的人类交互标注。

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [2] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究通过噪声注入技术提高COVID-19胸部X光图像识别模型在分布外数据上的泛化能力，显著缩小了分布内和分布外数据之间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在图像识别中容易学习源特定的伪影而非真实生物标志物，导致在分布外数据上泛化能力差，特别是在COVID-19胸部X光检测中。

Method: 在训练过程中使用基础噪声注入技术，包括高斯噪声、斑点噪声、泊松噪声和椒盐噪声。

Result: 噪声注入技术将分布内和分布外评估之间的性能差距从0.10-0.20显著降低到0.01-0.06，基于AUC、F1、准确率、召回率和特异性等关键指标在十个随机种子上的平均结果。

Conclusion: 噪声注入是一种有效提高深度学习模型对分布偏移鲁棒性的技术，能够显著改善模型在分布外数据上的泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

### [3] [Investigating Robot Control Policy Learning for Autonomous X-ray-guided Spine Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03882)
*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了模仿学习在X射线引导脊柱手术中的应用，开发了模拟环境训练基于视觉的插管对齐策略，在68.5%的情况下首次尝试成功，并展示了良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模仿学习方法是否适用于X射线引导的脊柱手术，特别是解决多视图X射线解读复杂性的挑战，为CT-free机器人脊柱导航提供基础。

Method: 开发高真实度的X射线引导脊柱手术模拟环境，收集正确轨迹和双平面X射线序列数据集，训练基于视觉信息的模仿学习策略进行规划和开环控制。

Result: 策略在68.5%的案例中首次尝试成功，能够维持安全的椎弓根内轨迹，对复杂解剖结构（包括骨折）具有良好的泛化能力，在真实X射线上也能产生合理轨迹。

Conclusion: 虽然初步结果有希望，但存在入针点精度等限制，完全闭环控制需要更频繁的反馈机制，结合更强的先验知识和领域知识，可为轻量级无CT机器人脊柱导航提供基础。

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [4] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLOv12的轻量级实时目标检测框架，结合自对抗训练和专门数据增强策略，用于沙漠环境中的垃圾检测，在精度和效率方面取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球垃圾危机日益严重，传统垃圾收集方法在偏远或恶劣环境（如沙漠）中效率低下且危险。现有研究主要关注城市环境和可回收材料，忽视了有机和危险垃圾以及沙漠等未充分探索的地形。

Method: 基于修剪的轻量级YOLOv12版本，集成自对抗训练（SAT）和专门的数据增强策略，使用DroneTrashNet数据集进行训练。

Result: 在精度、召回率和平均精度（mAP）方面取得显著改进，同时实现低延迟和小模型尺寸，适合在资源受限的无人机上部署。与最先进的轻量级YOLO变体相比，在准确性和效率方面达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 结合数据中心和模型中心增强的方法对于在沙漠环境中实现鲁棒的实时垃圾检测是有效的。

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [5] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于类别的图像合成方法，通过将同一类别的多张图像融合成复合图像来增强训练样本的信息密度和类内方差，从而在小样本和不平衡数据集上显著提升深度学习模型的诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小样本、不平衡数据集和低质量输入图像导致深度学习模型预测错误率高的问题，通过增强训练样本的信息含量来改善模型对细微疾病模式的识别能力。

Method: 提出基于类别的图像合成方法，将同一类别的多张图像融合成3x1布局的复合图像，构建平衡数据集Co-OCTDL，使用VGG16模型进行对比实验。

Result: 在光学相干断层扫描数据集上，该方法将准确率提升至99.6%，F1分数达到0.995，AUC为0.9996，显著降低了错误预测率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理不平衡数据集和小样本问题，即使在弱数据集上也能产生高质量的预测结果。

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [6] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了边界距离回归(BDR)和自适应时间细化(ATR)两种互补方法，用于改进时序动作定位中的边界检测。BDR通过有符号距离回归提供信息理论最优定位，ATR通过连续深度选择自适应分配计算资源，在减少18%计算量的同时提升2.9%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时序动作定位方法对所有边界采用统一计算，但不同边界的检测难度存在显著差异。这种均匀处理方式未能有效利用计算资源，限制了定位精度和效率。

Method: 1. 边界距离回归(BDR)：用有符号距离回归替代分类方法，提供信息理论最优的边界定位；2. 自适应时间细化(ATR)：通过连续深度选择参数τ∈[0,1]自适应分配计算资源，实现端到端可微分优化。

Result: 在THUMOS14数据集上，ATR在162G FLOPs下达到56.5% mAP@0.7，相比均匀处理的53.6%(198G FLOPs)，性能提升2.9%同时计算量减少18%。BDR可仅用约50行代码集成到现有方法中，在多种架构上带来1.8-3.1%的mAP@0.7提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的BDR和ATR方法通过自适应计算分配和优化的边界回归策略，显著提升了时序动作定位的精度和效率。该方法在四个基准数据集上得到验证，并通过严格统计测试证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

### [7] [Improving Multi-View Reconstruction via Texture-Guided Gaussian-Mesh Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03950)
*Zhejia Cai,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Hongkun Cao,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一处理几何和外观优化的框架，通过高斯引导的网格可微渲染同时优化网格几何（顶点位置和面）和顶点颜色，实现高质量3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常在几何精度（多视角立体）和逼真渲染（新视角合成）之间权衡，将几何和外观优化解耦，这阻碍了下游编辑任务。

Method: 提出一个新颖框架，通过高斯引导的网格可微渲染同时优化网格几何和顶点颜色，利用输入图像的光度一致性和法线深度图的几何正则化。

Result: 获得了高质量的3D重建结果，可进一步用于下游编辑任务，如重新照明和形状变形。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了几何和外观的联合优化，为3D编辑、AR/VR和数字内容创建等应用提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于线性分数变换参数的轻场相机标定方法，通过解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列实现精确内部参数校准，包含最小二乘解析解和非线性优化，在物理和仿真数据上验证性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻场相机在3D重建中需要精确的内部参数校准，但这是一个具有挑战性的前提条件。

Method: 提出线性分数变换参数α来解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列，包括基于最小二乘的解析解和非线性优化，同时介绍了从原始图像中检测特征的方法。

Result: 在物理和仿真数据上的实验验证了所提方法的性能，基于该模型的原始轻场图像仿真速度更快，这对数据驱动的深度学习方法至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法为轻场相机提供了有效的内部参数校准方案，并促进了基于深度学习的数据驱动方法的发展。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's
website.

### [9] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Room Envelopes合成数据集，用于训练单目几何估计器预测可见表面和结构布局表面，以理解场景范围和物体形状位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景重建方法只能恢复可见表面，无法重建被遮挡的结构元素（如墙壁、地板、天花板），而这些元素通常平面、重复且简单，应该相对容易预测。

Method: 创建Room Envelopes合成数据集，提供RGB图像和两个关联点图：可见表面点图和移除家具后的结构布局点图，用于直接监督前馈单目几何估计器。

Result: 该数据集能够训练模型同时预测第一可见表面和第一布局表面，从而理解场景的完整范围以及物体的形状和位置。

Conclusion: 通过Room Envelopes数据集，可以实现对场景结构元素的准确预测，弥补现有重建方法在遮挡表面重建方面的不足。

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [10] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明3D姿态信息在人类社交互动识别中起关键作用，仅使用面部位置和方向的简单3D社交姿态特征就能达到与完整3D关节信息相当的预测能力，并能显著提升AI视觉模型的社交判断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类如何从视觉输入中快速提取社交互动信息，以及为什么当前最先进的AI视觉系统在社交互动识别方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 结合最先进的姿态和深度估计算法提取视频中人物的3D关节位置，与AI视觉模型进行比较，并推导出一组紧凑的3D社交姿态特征来描述面部的位置和方向。

Result: 3D关节位置在预测人类社交互动判断方面优于大多数当前AI视觉模型；仅使用面部位置和方向的简单3D社交姿态特征能达到与完整3D关节信息相当的预测能力，并能显著提升现成AI视觉模型的性能。

Conclusion: 人类社交场景理解依赖于3D姿态的显式表征，可以通过简单、结构化的视觉空间基元来支持。

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

### [11] [CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992)
*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaRF是一个用于3D高斯场中语言引导分割的框架，通过引入相机感知机制和跨视图监督，解决了现有方法在多视图一致性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D渲染伪监督和视图特定特征学习，导致跨视图一致性差，需要开发直接在3D高斯空间中操作且保持多视图一致性的框架。

Method: 提出高斯场相机编码(GFCE)将相机几何融入高斯文本交互，建模视图依赖变化；引入训练配对视图监督(ITPVS)在训练期间对齐不同视图的高斯logits。

Result: 在三个基准测试上，CaRF相比最先进方法在mIoU指标上分别提升16.8%、4.3%和2.0%，显著改善了跨视图一致性。

Conclusion: CaRF实现了更可靠和视图一致的3D场景理解，对具身AI、AR/VR交互和自主感知具有潜在益处。

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

### [12] [Near-Lossless 3D Voxel Representation Free from Iso-surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04029)
*Yihao Luo,Xianglong He,Chuanyu Pan,Yiwen Chen,Jiaqi Wu,Yangguang Li,Wanli Ouyang,Yuanming Hu,Guang Yang,ChoonHwai Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Faithful Contouring，一种稀疏体素化表示方法，支持2048+分辨率，无需将网格转换为场函数或提取等值面，实现了近乎无损的保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于等值面的体素化表示严重依赖水密化或渲染优化，不可避免地损害几何保真度。

Method: 采用稀疏体素化表示，保留尖锐特征和内部结构；设计双模式自编码器，支持可扩展且保持细节的形状重建。

Result: 在直接表示方面达到10^{-5}级别的距离误差；在网格重建方面，Chamfer距离减少93%，F-score提高35%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring在3D学习任务中作为表示方法具有卓越的保真度，在准确性和效率方面均超越现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

### [13] [A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Robust Biometric Authentication from Low-Frame-Rate PPG Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04037)
*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于PPG信号的轻量级生物认证框架，使用低帧率指尖视频提取PPG信号，通过预处理和时频分析，结合CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM混合深度学习模型，在46名受试者上达到98%的认证准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG信号因其无创采集、活体检测特性和适用于低成本可穿戴设备而在生物认证中受到关注，但信号质量受运动伪影、光照变化和个体生理差异影响，需要稳健的特征提取和分类方法。

Method: 使用CFIHSR数据集，对原始PPG信号进行预处理（基线漂移去除、PCA运动伪影抑制、带通滤波、傅里叶重采样、幅度归一化），通过CWT将一维信号转换为二维时频尺度图，开发CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM混合深度学习模型结合空间和时间特征。

Result: 在46名受试者上的实验结果显示认证准确率达到98%，验证了模型对噪声和个体间差异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该系统具有高效性、可扩展性和固有的活体检测能力，非常适合现实世界的移动和嵌入式生物安全应用。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bratrix是一个端到端的多模态语言锚定视觉-大脑对齐框架，通过将视觉刺激解耦为层次化视觉和语言语义组件，并将视觉和大脑表征投影到共享潜在空间，实现视觉-语言和大脑-语言嵌入的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要将神经活动直接与视觉嵌入对齐，但仅视觉表示往往无法捕捉潜在语义维度，限制了可解释性和深度鲁棒性。需要解决主体变异性和视觉特征纠缠的挑战。

Method: 提出Bratrix框架，包含不确定性感知模块进行对齐加权，使用可学习的语言锚定语义矩阵增强跨模态相关性，采用两阶段训练策略（单模态预训练+多模态微调）。

Result: 在EEG、MEG和fMRI基准测试中，Bratrix在检索、重建和字幕生成任务上优于最先进方法，特别是在200-way EEG检索任务中提升了14.3%。

Conclusion: Bratrix通过多模态语言锚定方法有效解决了神经信号解码中的语义理解挑战，为视觉语义从神经信号中的提取提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

Motivation: 单目深度估计在无人系统中具有重要应用价值，但现有方法在嵌入式系统上存在深度估计性能差和物体边界模糊的问题。

Method: 设计了增强特征自适应融合模块（EFAF）来自适应融合深度特征以增强边界细节表示，并在编码器中集成语义知识以提升物体识别和边界感知能力。

Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
because of its low?cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges
of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded
systems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model,
BoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters. It can accurately estimate
depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality.
Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which
adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation.
Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the
object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is
deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous
lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed
ablation studies for the proposed methods. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UKAST是一种结合Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks的U-Net架构，通过集成有理函数基础的KAN到Swin Transformer编码器中，解决了传统CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中的局限性，在数据稀缺环境下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临复杂解剖结构和标注数据有限的挑战。CNN擅长局部特征提取但难以建模长距离依赖，Transformer能有效捕获全局上下文但数据需求大且计算昂贵。

Method: 提出UKAST架构，将基于有理函数的Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks集成到Swin Transformer编码器中，使用Group Rational KANs提高表达能力和数据效率，相比SwinUNETR仅轻微增加参数量但减少FLOPs。

Result: 在四个不同的2D和3D医学图像分割基准测试中达到最先进性能，持续超越CNN和Transformer基线方法，在数据稀缺设置下获得更优精度，缓解了标准Vision Transformer的数据饥饿问题。

Conclusion: KAN增强的Transformer有潜力推进数据高效的医学图像分割，UKAST展示了在减少计算复杂度的同时保持高精度的能力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST

TL;DR: SpatialLock是一个新颖的文本到图像生成框架，通过感知信号和定位信息联合控制对象空间位置，解决了现有方法在对象定位精度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像合成方法未能充分利用位置信息，导致对对象空间布局理解不足，难以实现精确的对象定位控制。

Method: 提出SpatialLock框架，包含两个组件：位置参与注入(PoI)通过注意力层直接整合空间信息；位置引导学习(PoG)使用基于感知的监督进一步优化对象定位。

Result: 实验表明SpatialLock在精确对象定位方面达到新的最先进水平，在多个数据集上IOU得分超过0.9。

Conclusion: SpatialLock能够生成具有精确空间排列的对象，并提高生成图像的视觉质量，为文本到图像合成中的对象定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THG是一种无需训练的策略，通过将分类器自由引导ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统，显著加速扩散采样同时保持高保真度生成。该方法将噪声估计和额外引导项分别在不同时间步网格上积分，减少30%函数评估次数且几乎不损失生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型采样方法存在计算冗余，传统求解器未能充分利用额外引导项对数值误差的鲁棒性，导致采样效率低下。

Method: 将CFG ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统，噪声估计在细粒度时间步网格上积分（乌龟方程），额外引导项在粗粒度网格上积分（野兔方程），并引入误差边界感知时间步采样器和引导尺度调度器。

Result: THG在相同计算预算下将函数评估次数减少高达30%，生成保真度几乎无损失（ΔImageReward ≤ 0.032），优于现有基于CFG的无训练加速器。

Conclusion: 多速率公式为扩散求解器提供了新潜力，为实现无需模型重新训练的高质量实时图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的草图生成方法主要关注通用合成，缺乏对草图风格的精确控制机制，需要开发能够通过文本和参考草图进行显式风格指导的方法。

Method: 提出基于扩散模型的免训练框架，通过线性平滑将参考特征作为辅助信息，采用风格-内容指导机制，避免自注意力中键值矩阵覆盖，并扩展支持多风格生成。

Result: 实验表明该方法在参考草图与目标草图结构相似度低的情况下仍能保持高质量合成，实现准确的风格对齐和更灵活的风格控制。

Conclusion: M3S框架在草图生成中实现了高质量的样式对齐和增强的灵活性，为可控草图风格生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文档理解中，扫描或拍摄文档的正确方向确定是一个关键的预处理步骤。准确的旋转校正对于提升OCR等下游任务的性能至关重要，因为用户错误（特别是相机基础方向错误）经常导致图像不对齐。

Method: 首先引入ORB基准测试，包括ORB-En（基于旋转变换的英文OCR数据集）和ORB-Indic（涵盖11种印度语言的新多语言数据集）。然后提出了基于Phi-3.5-Vision模型视觉编码器的快速旋转分类管道，采用动态图像裁剪技术，专门针对4类旋转任务进行微调。

Result: 旋转分类方法在两个数据集上分别达到96%和92%的准确率。在模拟真实世界设置中，该模块显著提升了闭源OCR模型（最高14%）和开源权重模型（最高4倍）的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了旋转校正模块在提升OCR性能中的关键作用，特别是在处理用户错误导致的图像旋转问题时，提出的方法能够有效解决这一挑战。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字病理学中，准确配准不同模态的图像对于直接比较和整合信息至关重要，支持生物标志物分析和组织重建等应用。

Method: 使用20对组织样本，采用多种预处理步骤（包括CycleGAN、Macenko、Reinhard、Vahadane颜色转换、反转、对比度调整、强度归一化和去噪），通过VALIS配准方法进行配准，并评估相对目标配准误差。

Result: 在两种场景（使用原始或反转多模态图像）中，CycleGAN颜色转换均实现了最低的配准误差，而其他方法显示出更高的误差。

Conclusion: 在配准前应用颜色转换可改善不同模态图像之间的对齐，支持数字病理学中更可靠的分析。

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的自适应统计融合器（AStF），通过引入偏度和峰度两个高阶统计量来改进人体运动风格迁移，解决了传统方法仅依赖均值和方差的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均值和方差的图像风格迁移方法在运动风格迁移中效果有限，因为运动数据具有复杂的动态模式和时空一致性特性，需要更全面的统计建模。

Method: 提出了自适应统计融合器（AStF），包含风格解耦模块（SDM）和高阶多统计注意力机制（HOS-Attn），并结合运动一致性正则化（MCR）判别器进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过更全面地建模动态风格中的时空统计模式，AStF在运动风格迁移方面表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: 引入偏度和峰度等高阶统计量能够更有效地捕捉运动风格特征，提升运动风格迁移的质量和真实感。

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Conclusion: 人类中心基础模型为解剖标志点检测提供了强大的空间定位先验，这一潜力此前未被充分开发。MedSapiens证明了这种适配策略的有效性。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成图像和深度伪造生成模型的日益复杂，源归属和真实性验证成为计算机视觉系统的关键挑战。扩散模型无意中在其输出中留下持续的统计痕迹（信号泄漏），特别是在潜在表示中。

Conclusion: 在潜在空间中建模信号泄漏偏差能够实现可靠且可解释的AI图像和深度伪造取证。

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

Conclusion: 通过结合DINOv2的语义先验和步态特征学习，提出的框架能够生成高度判别性的特征表示，有效解决跨模态行人重识别问题。

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Shiwei Ren,Tianci Wen,Yongchun Fang,Biao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastGS是一个新颖的3D高斯溅射加速框架，通过基于多视图一致性的致密化和剪枝策略，显著提升了训练速度，在多个数据集上实现了3.32-15.45倍的加速效果，同时保持可比的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射加速方法未能有效控制高斯数量，导致冗余计算时间开销。FastGS旨在通过多视图一致性来评估每个高斯的重要性，解决训练时间与渲染质量之间的权衡问题。

Method: 创新性地设计了基于多视图一致性的致密化和剪枝策略，摒弃了预算机制。该方法完全考虑每个高斯的重要性，实现高效的训练加速。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360、Tanks & Temples和Deep Blending数据集上的实验表明，相比DashGaussian在Mip-NeRF 360上实现3.32倍训练加速，相比vanilla 3DGS在Deep Blending上实现15.45倍加速，渲染质量相当。

Conclusion: FastGS展现出强大的泛化能力，在动态场景重建、表面重建、稀疏视图重建、大规模重建和SLAM等各种任务中提供2-7倍的训练加速。

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 本研究将通用视觉基础模型适配到除草剂试验表征领域，通过自监督学习在农业数据集上训练，显著提升了物种识别和损伤分类性能，特别是在未见条件下的表现更优，同时大幅减少了标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 除草剂田间试验需要准确识别植物物种和评估除草剂引起的损伤，但通用视觉基础模型在农业领域的细粒度区分能力有限，因此需要开发针对除草剂试验的领域专用模型。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法在大型农业数据集上训练通用视觉基础模型，学习针对除草剂试验图像的丰富且可迁移的表征。

Result: 领域专用模型在物种识别（F1从0.91提升至0.94）和损伤分类（从0.26提升至0.33）上显著优于通用模型。在未见条件下表现更佳（物种识别从0.56到0.66；损伤分类从0.17到0.27），在无人机图像等域偏移场景中保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: 领域专用预训练模型具有强大的泛化能力，能显著减少人工标注工作量，为除草剂试验分析提供了可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

### [29] [Deep learning-based object detection of offshore platforms on Sentinel-1 Imagery and the impact of synthetic training data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04304)
*Robin Spanier,Thorsten Hoeser,Claudia Kuenzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用合成和真实Sentinel-1卫星图像训练YOLOv10模型，通过区域保留评估验证模型的地理可迁移性，证明合成数据能提升不平衡类别表示和模型性能，为全球海上基础设施监测提供了可行方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着海上基础设施的快速扩张，需要有效的监测系统。现有检测模型在样本稀缺时性能不足，特别是对于代表性不足的物体类别、形状和尺寸。

Method: 使用合成和真实Sentinel-1卫星图像训练YOLOv10目标检测模型，在四个区域（里海、南海、几内亚湾、巴西海岸）进行训练，并在三个未见区域（墨西哥湾、北海、波斯湾）评估地理可迁移性。

Result: 共检测到3,529个海上平台，模型F1分数达到0.85，加入合成数据后提升至0.90，证明模型能够泛化到训练区域之外。

Conclusion: 平衡数据集对于模型性能至关重要，合成数据生成是解决遥感领域常见挑战的有效策略，深度学习具有实现可扩展的全球海上基础设施监测的潜力。

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

*Xiangjun Zhang,Litong Gong,Yinglin Zheng,Yansong Liu,Wentao Jiang,Mingyi Xu,Biao Wang,Tiezheng Ge,Ming Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE-T2V是一个创新的文本到视频生成框架，通过集成提示词重述和语义特征提取，解决了传统模型在简洁提示下视频质量下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到视频扩散模型依赖预训练文本编码器进行语义对齐，但在简洁提示下视频质量较差，且无法在线重述提示词来更好地匹配用户意图，限制了模型的可扩展性和可用性。

Method: 提出RISE-T2V框架，集成提示词重述和语义特征提取为一个步骤。引入重述适配器模块，使扩散模型能够利用LLM在下一个令牌预测时的文本隐藏状态作为视频生成条件。

Result: RISE-T2V是一个通用框架，适用于不同的预训练LLM和视频扩散模型，显著提升了文本到视频任务的能力。实验证明该框架能生成更符合用户意图的高质量视频。

Conclusion: RISE-T2V通过创新的重述适配器机制，有效解决了文本到视频生成中的语义理解不足问题，提升了模型的生成质量和用户意图匹配度。

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了传感器遮挡对基于BEV融合的3D目标检测性能的影响，发现相机遮挡导致41.3%的mAP下降，LiDAR在重度遮挡下下降47.3%，融合模型中LiDAR遮挡影响更大（26.8%下降）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索传感器遮挡（如雾、霾等环境条件）对基于BEV融合的3D目标检测准确性的影响，这一问题在现有研究中尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用BEVFusion架构在nuScenes数据集上评估相机和LiDAR传感器遮挡对3D检测性能的影响，采用mAP和NDS作为评估指标。

Result: 相机中度遮挡导致仅相机检测mAP下降41.3%（35.6%→20.9%）；LiDAR重度遮挡下降47.3%（64.7%→34.1%）；融合设置中相机遮挡仅下降4.1%（68.5%→65.7%），LiDAR遮挡下降26.8%（至50.1%），显示模型更依赖LiDAR。

Conclusion: 需要开发遮挡感知的评估方法和改进的传感器融合技术，以在部分传感器失效或环境条件恶化时保持检测准确性。

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 本教程填补了分析化学领域深度学习应用的知识空白，为研究人员提供了实用的工具和方法来提取和整合成像数据的空间信息。

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

Abstract: We present a multi-task framework for the MediaEval Medico 2025 challenge,
leveraging a LoRA-tuned Florence-2 model for simultaneous visual question
answering (VQA), explanation generation, and visual grounding. The proposed
system integrates three curated datasets: (1) Kvasir-VQA-x1 for question-answer
learning, (2) a synthetically enriched explanation dataset offering structured
medical reasoning, and (3) text-to-region pairs linking visual features with
segmentation masks. This multi-task setup enables the model to jointly learn
visual grounding, reasoning, and interpretation, producing responses that are
both accurate and interpretable. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach substantially improves over single-task baselines in both answer
accuracy and visual localization, highlighting the effectiveness of grounded
multi-task learning for medical VQA applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HideAndSeg是一个用于分割章鱼视频的AI工具，结合SAM2和YOLOv11，通过最小化监督实现自动化分割，并引入无监督指标评估分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 章鱼在自然栖息地中难以分析，因其伪装能力、快速皮肤变化、非刚性变形和频繁遮挡，加上水下光照和浑浊度变化，且缺乏大规模标注数据集。

Method: 集成SAM2与定制训练的YOLOv11对象检测器。用户提供点坐标生成初始分割掩码，作为YOLO训练数据，然后通过边界框提示实现全自动分割管道。

Result: HideAndSeg表现满意，相比手动提示方法减少分割噪声，能在完全遮挡后重新识别和分割章鱼，而手动提示模型在此场景下失败。

Conclusion: 该工作通过减少真实场景中手动分析需求，为野生头足类动物行为研究提供了实用工具，开辟了更高效研究途径。

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Conclusion: 成功扩展了拼图求解器的处理范围，为凸多边形拼图提供了有效的计算方法，并建立了相关基准数据集，为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

Motivation: 滑坡对生命、基础设施和环境造成严重破坏，需要准确及时的测绘来进行灾害准备和响应。传统深度学习模型在不同传感器、区域或有限训练数据条件下表现不佳。

Method: 采用三轴分析框架（传感器、标签、领域）来适应地理空间基础模型Prithvi-EO-2.0，结合全局预训练、自监督学习和适应性微调技术。

Result: 该模型在性能上持续优于任务特定的CNN（U-Net、U-Net++）、视觉变换器（Segformer、SwinV2-B）和其他GeoFMs（TerraMind、SatMAE），对光谱变化具有弹性，在标签稀缺条件下保持准确性，并在不同数据集和地理环境中具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeoFMs为滑坡风险减少和环境监测提供了更稳健和可扩展的方法，但仍面临计算成本高和可重用AI训练数据有限等挑战。

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

Motivation: 视频生成技术快速发展，但评估指标的发展滞后。当前说话头生成评估主要依赖有限指标和用户研究，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出包含8个指标的三维评估框架（质量、自然度、同步性），重点分析头部、嘴巴、眉毛的细粒度动态以及面部质量，强调效率和与人类偏好的一致性。

Result: 在17个最先进模型生成的85,000个视频上进行广泛实验，发现许多算法在唇部同步方面表现良好，但在生成表现力和无伪影细节方面面临挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的基准框架旨在评估生成方法的改进，原始代码、数据集和排行榜将公开发布并定期更新，以反映该领域的进展。

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

Motivation: 准确评估腹腔镜胆囊切除术的手术复杂性至关重要，因为严重炎症与更长的手术时间和更高的术后并发症风险相关。虽然Parkland分级系统提供了临床验证的分层框架，但其在手术视频中的自动化应用仍未被充分探索，特别是在需要分析完整视频而非手动剪辑片段的现实场景中。

Method: 提出STC-Net框架，包含定位、窗口提议和分级三个模块，通过结合硬和软定位目标以及背景感知分级监督的新型损失函数，在弱时间监督下联合执行时间定位和分级。

Result: 在1,859个腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频的私有数据集上评估，STC-Net达到62.11%的准确率和61.42%的F1分数，比非定位基线方法在两个指标上都高出10%以上。

Conclusion: STC-Net展示了一种可扩展且有效的方法，能够从完整的腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中自动进行基于PGS的手术复杂性评估，有望用于术后分析和手术培训。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

TL;DR: UniSplat是一个用于自动驾驶的前馈3D重建框架，通过统一的潜在时空融合学习鲁棒的动态场景重建，解决了稀疏、非重叠相机视角和复杂场景动态的联合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理稀疏、非重叠相机视角和复杂场景动态的联合挑战时表现不佳，需要一种能够有效整合空间视图和时间帧信息的鲁棒重建框架。

Method: 构建3D潜在支架作为结构化表示，利用预训练基础模型捕获几何和语义场景上下文；引入在3D支架内直接操作的高效融合机制实现一致的时空对齐；设计双分支解码器，结合点锚定细化和基于体素的生成来生成动态感知高斯，并维护静态高斯的持久内存以实现流式场景补全。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，UniSplat在新视角合成方面实现了最先进的性能，即使对于原始相机覆盖范围之外的视点也能提供鲁棒且高质量的渲染。

Conclusion: UniSplat通过统一的潜在时空融合框架，成功解决了自动驾驶中动态场景重建的关键挑战，为稀疏、非重叠相机设置下的鲁棒3D重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

*Yicheng Xiao,Yu Chen,Haoxuan Ma,Jiale Hong,Caorui Li,Lingxiang Wu,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCLIP是一个新颖的框架，旨在同时处理视觉提示输入和长文本描述，通过像素级对齐学习实现细粒度图像-文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面存在局限，特别是文本编码器的令牌长度限制阻碍了处理更细粒度文本信息的能力。现有方法主要关注增强视觉信息处理的粒度，但缺乏对文本处理能力的提升。

Method: 1) 建立自动化标注流水线生成像素级定位的长文本描述，构建包含近150万样本的LongGRIT数据集；2) 用LLM替换CLIP的原始文本编码器；3) 提出三分支像素-文本对齐学习框架，实现任意粒度级别的图像区域与对应文本描述的细粒度对齐。

Result: 实验证明PixCLIP在像素级交互和处理长文本方面取得突破，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PixCLIP通过协同增强视觉和文本内容处理的粒度，有效解决了CLIP在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面的局限性，为视觉语言理解任务提供了更强大的基础模型。

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动化、基于准确性的框架来评估虚拟免疫组化染色图像质量，通过计算染色精度指标直接量化像素级标记准确性，发现传统图像保真度指标与染色精度相关性差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于纹理和分布的图像质量评估指标只能量化图像保真度，无法准确评估免疫组化染色的准确性，需要一种能够直接量化染色准确性的自动化评估方法。

Method: 使用颜色反卷积生成IHC阳性像素掩码，通过计算真实和虚拟IHC的分割掩码之间的染色精度指标（Dice、IoU、Hausdorff距离）来直接量化像素级标记准确性，无需专家手动标注。

Result: 传统图像保真度指标（FID、PSNR、SSIM）与染色精度和病理学家评估相关性差；配对的PyramidPix2Pix和AdaptiveNCE模型染色精度最高；非配对扩散和GAN模型在提供准确IHC阳性像素标记方面可靠性较低；全切片图像评估显示补丁级评估无法发现的性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估虚拟IHC模型质量提供了一种可重复的方法，是加速病理学家常规使用的关键步骤，强调需要全切片图像级别的基准测试。

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的流式视频质量评估模型，该模型无需参考视频且无需人工标注，通过利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化训练时域感知卷积架构来预测全参考指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法存在局限性：全参考方法需要干净参考视频，大多数无参考模型依赖昂贵的人工标注，而大多数无人工标注的无参考方法是基于图像的，忽略了视频对象检测中关键的时域上下文。

Method: 利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化，训练时域感知卷积架构直接从退化视频预测全参考指标（LPIPS、PSNR、SSIM），在推理时无需参考视频。

Result: 流式方法优于图像基线，能够泛化到多种退化类型；与广泛使用的BRISQUE相比，与全参考指标的相关性更高。

Conclusion: 时域建模对于现实世界视觉系统中可扩展的视频质量评估具有重要价值，验证了基于时域的无人工标注方法的有效性。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种诊断和去偏多模态基准测试的方法，通过测试集压力测试和迭代偏置剪枝来识别和消除非视觉偏差，确保基准测试真正评估视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型基准测试存在严重问题，模型可以通过利用偏差、语言先验和表面模式而非真正的视觉理解来获得高分，这尤其影响需要视觉输入的视觉中心基准测试。

Method: 采用测试集压力测试方法，通过仅使用测试集的非视觉文本输入对大型语言模型进行k折交叉验证微调，揭示捷径性能并为每个样本分配偏置分数；同时使用基于随机森林的轻量级诊断工具进行快速可解释审计；通过迭代偏置剪枝程序过滤高偏置样本来去偏基准测试。

Result: 在四个基准测试（VSI-Bench、CV-Bench、MMMU和VideoMME）中发现了普遍存在的非视觉偏差。通过完整框架创建了VSI-Bench-Debiased，相比原始版本减少了非视觉可解性并扩大了视觉盲性能差距。

Conclusion: 基准测试设计应采用诊断原则：如果基准测试可以被游戏化，那么它就会被游戏化。设计者应首先尝试"游戏"自己的基准测试，使用诊断和去偏程序系统性地识别和减轻非视觉偏差。

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

Motivation: 当前多模态语言模型在时空空间推理方面存在困难，而获取具有精确空间标注的多样化真实世界视频数据存在瓶颈，需要寻找替代方案来提升模型的空间推理能力。

Method: 开发了SIMS-V数据生成框架，利用3D模拟器生成空间丰富的视频训练数据，通过系统消融实验分析问题类型、混合方式和规模对真实世界迁移效果的影响。

Result: 识别出三种最有效的问题类别，仅用25K模拟示例训练的7B参数模型在真实世界空间推理基准上超越了72B基线模型，与专有模型性能相当，同时在通用视频理解任务上保持性能。

Conclusion: 模拟数据可以有效替代真实世界视频数据来训练空间推理能力，通过精心选择的问题类型可以实现高效训练和强大的真实世界泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态智能系统主要关注反应式任务驱动方法，缺乏对空间认知和世界建模的深度理解。需要推动从语言理解向空间超感知的范式转变，以发展真正的多模态智能。

Method: 提出空间超感知的四个发展阶段框架，开发VSI-SUPER基准测试（包含VSR和VSC任务），通过数据扩展训练Cambrian-S模型，并引入基于预测误差的自监督下一潜在帧预测器方法。

Result: 数据扩展使VSI-Bench性能提升30%，但在VSI-SUPER上表现仍有限。预测性感知方法显著优于领先的专有基线，证明预测性世界建模对空间超感知的重要性。

Conclusion: 仅靠规模扩展不足以实现空间超感知，需要开发能够预测、选择和组织经验的模型。预测性感知为多模态智能的发展提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely
discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a
single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of
generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long
interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,
outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some
diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model
generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading
diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete
autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p

Method: 提出了TubeletGraph零样本系统，首先识别可能被忽略的跟踪轨迹，基于语义和邻近性先验决定是否整合这些轨迹，然后推理添加的轨迹并生成描述每个观察到的转换的状态图。

Conclusion: TubeletGraph系统成功解决了物体状态转换过程中的跟踪问题，提供了对物体状态演化的深度理解，并为复杂物体转换的分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

### [52] [Extracting Causal Relations in Deep Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03948)
*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文挑战了深度知识追踪(DKT)模型性能提升源于建模知识组件间双向关系的传统解释，证明DKT的真正优势在于其隐式建模先决条件关系的因果结构能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期以来计算教育研究的目标是开发可解释的知识追踪模型。DKT作为传统KT方法的重大进步，其性能提升原因存在争议，需要澄清其真正的工作原理。

Method: 通过将练习关系图修剪为有向无环图(DAGs)，在Assistments数据集的因果子集上训练DKT，并使用DKT学习表示提取练习关系DAGs的替代方法。

Result: 实验表明DKT的预测能力与因果结构高度一致，其学习表示能够有效提取先决条件关系。

Conclusion: DKT的有效性主要源于其近似知识组件间因果依赖关系的能力，而非简单的关系映射。

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

### [53] [LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980)
*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同语言和文化框架下对人类价值观的响应，发现虽然提示语言和文化视角会影响模型输出，但LLMs存在系统性偏向特定国家价值观的偏见，无法充分代表文化多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在全球范围内被广泛使用，但训练数据和优化目标存在不平衡，研究人员质疑LLMs是否能代表其广泛用户群体的文化多样性。

Method: 使用来自霍夫斯泰德价值观调查模块和世界价值观调查的63个项目，翻译成11种语言，以带有和不带有明确文化视角的提示形式测试10个LLMs。

Result: 提示语言和文化视角都会导致LLM输出变化，但模型存在向荷兰、德国、美国和日本等少数国家价值观的系统性偏见。明确的文视角比针对性提示语言更能提高与人类受访者文化价值观的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs处于一个尴尬的中间地带：它们对提示变化足够敏感以产生变化，但又过于固着于特定文化默认值，无法充分代表文化多样性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了多智能体AI系统中的异常检测任务，构建了两个包含4,275和894条轨迹的数据集，并比较了监督和半监督方法在检测漂移、循环和细节缺失等故障方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体AI系统具有非确定性，容易发生漂移、循环和输出细节缺失等难以检测的静默故障，需要系统化的异常检测方法。

Method: 开发了数据集构建流程，捕捉用户行为、智能体非确定性和LLM变异性，构建了两个基准数据集，并评估了XGBoost和SVDD等异常检测方法。

Result: 监督方法(XGBoost)和半监督方法(SVDD)表现相当，准确率分别达到98%和96%，为多智能体AI系统异常检测提供了首个系统研究。

Conclusion: 该工作为多智能体AI系统的异常检测提供了数据集、基准测试和见解，为未来研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,
and insights to guide future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大语言模型在数值推理中的内部表示机制，发现LLMs会编码现实世界的数值相关性但系统性地放大它们，无关上下文会引发数值表示的一致偏移，揭示了LLM决策中的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管行为研究已记录了大语言模型在数值推理中的错误，但其底层表示机制仍不清楚。研究者假设数值属性占据共享的潜在子空间，并探讨LLMs如何内部整合单个实体的多个数值属性，以及无关数值上下文如何干扰这些表示及其下游输出。

Method: 结合线性探测与偏相关分析，以及在不同规模模型上进行基于提示的脆弱性测试，来研究LLMs内部数值表示的整合机制和上下文干扰效应。

Result: 结果显示LLMs编码了现实世界的数值相关性但倾向于系统性地放大它们，无关上下文会引发数值表示的一致偏移，且下游效应因模型规模而异。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了LLM决策中的脆弱性，为在多属性纠缠下实现更公平、表示感知的控制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理方面表现出色，但在处理知识密集型问题时受限于上下文长度和参数化知识，现有基于微调LLM或GNN检索器的方法存在数据集特定调优和扩展性不足的问题。

Method: 提出LLM-KGFR协作框架，包含知识图谱基础检索器(KGFR)，使用LLM生成的关系描述编码关系，基于问题中的角色初始化实体，采用非对称渐进传播(APP)算法高效处理大规模图，通过节点、边和路径级接口支持LLM迭代请求候选答案、支持事实和推理路径。

Result: 实验证明LLM-KGFR在保持可扩展性和泛化能力的同时实现了强劲性能，为知识图谱增强推理提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM-KGFR框架通过结合LLM和结构化检索器，有效解决了知识密集型推理问题，在零样本泛化、可扩展性和性能方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

TL;DR: Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework是一个概率-规范框架，用于量化工作流质量和效率，结合了正确性、可靠性和成本，支持工作流评估、排序和优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种统一的数学框架来量化工作流质量，实现直接比较、评分和优化，解决工作流评估中的结构、语义和信号相关问题。

Method: 结合Opus工作流奖励（概率函数估计性能）和Opus工作流规范惩罚（测量结构信息质量），支持自动化评估和强化学习集成。

Result: 提出了统一的工作流奖励模型和可测量的规范惩罚函数，建立了联合奖励-惩罚权衡的优化公式。

Conclusion: 该框架为工作流质量评估提供了数学基础，支持自动化系统的工作流发现和优化，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体预测编码框架，通过最小化智能体间的相互不确定性来解决协调问题，在带宽受限条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体系统中，部分可观测性和有限带宽常常导致协调失败，需要解决共享和重建一致空间记忆的挑战。

Method: 采用信息瓶颈目标，让智能体学习何时、与谁、以及如何通信；基于自监督运动预测生成网格细胞状度量作为内部空间编码；构建分层强化学习策略主动探索以减少联合不确定性。

Result: 在Memory-Maze基准测试中，方法对带宽约束表现出卓越韧性：当带宽从128位/步缩减到4位/步时，成功率从73.5%优雅下降到64.4%，而全广播基线从67.6%崩溃到28.6%。

Conclusion: 研究为复杂社会表征如何从统一的预测驱动中涌现提供了理论基础和生物学合理性，从而产生社会集体智能。

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLVR训练中的RL过拟合问题，即模型在训练中获得奖励但泛化能力下降，这由策略过度专业化和灾难性遗忘引起。

Method: 提出RLoop自改进框架，基于迭代策略初始化：先用RL从给定策略探索解空间，过滤成功轨迹创建专家数据集，然后通过拒绝采样微调(RFT)优化初始策略，为下一轮迭代提供更好的起点。

Result: RLoop有效缓解遗忘并显著提升泛化能力，相比标准RL平均准确率提高9%，pass@32指标提升超过15%。

Conclusion: RLoop通过将瞬时策略变化转化为稳健性能增益，成功解决了RLVR训练中的泛化问题。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设高探针精度意味着CAV能忠实表示目标概念，但作者发现探针更可能捕捉虚假相关性而非真正概念，需要更可靠的对齐度评估方法。

Method: 引入基于空间线性归因的新概念定位方法，与现有特征可视化技术进行比较，并提出三类定量评估概念对齐的指标：硬精度、分割分数和增强鲁棒性。

Result: 研究表明，具有平移不变性和空间对齐的探针能持续提高概念对齐度，而故意构建的错位探针也能达到接近标准探针的精度。

Conclusion: 需要基于对齐度的评估指标而非探针精度，且探针设计应适应模型架构和目标概念特性。

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

Conclusion: AdversariaLLM旨在为LLM安全研究建立一个透明、可比较和可复现的坚实基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a
toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on
reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible
research in LLM safety.

Motivation: 当前基于LLMs的医疗系统在药物安全方面的研究有限，缺乏真实世界数据集，且在真实临床咨询环境下的评估不足。

Method: 提出模拟临床咨询的框架，生成包含药物风险的问诊对话，构建专门的药物安全数据库RxRisk DB，采用两阶段过滤策略确保临床真实性和专业质量，创建RxSafeBench基准。

Result: 评估显示当前LLMs难以整合禁忌症和相互作用知识，特别是在风险隐含而非明确的情况下表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM系统中确保药物安全的关键挑战，为通过更好的提示和任务特定调优提高可靠性提供了见解，RxSafeBench为评估LLMs药物安全提供了首个全面基准。

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV)框架，通过在Generate-Verify范式前添加显式监控机制来解决模型早期陷入次优推理路径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时推理架构缺乏监控过程，导致模型容易陷入前缀主导陷阱，造成约20%的准确率损失。

Method: 将Flavell、Nelson和Narens的元认知理论形式化为计算规范，在生成前添加显式监控机制来捕捉元认知体验，并通过验证反馈来优化未来监控。

Result: 虽然未提供实证验证，但这是首次系统性地将基础元认知理论转化为计算规范。

Conclusion: MGV框架为理解推理系统失败提供了原则性词汇，并为未来测试时推理设计提出了具体的架构干预建议。

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

### [64] [The Peril of Preference: Why GRPO fails on Ordinal Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04439)
*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO)方法，解决了GRPO在使用序数奖励时对失败轨迹给予正优势值的问题，通过自适应基线确保失败解决方案不会被正向强化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO的简单性使其在将LLMs适应特定任务时很有吸引力，但这种简单性也使其在使用更丰富的非二元反馈时变得不适用，特别是在使用序数奖励给予部分学分时，GRPO的组平均基线经常对失败轨迹分配正优势值并强化错误行为。

Method: CoRPO使用自适应基线强制执行最低质量阈值，确保失败的解决方案永远不会被正向强化。一旦策略持续满足此阈值，基线会自动过渡到相对偏好模式，推动模型找到最优解决方案而不仅仅是'可接受'的解决方案。

Result: 在代码验证任务上进行了实证验证，CoRPO表现出更稳定的收敛性和更好的域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作是在通过强化学习使LLMs学习真正新能力的研究计划中的关键一步，通过使LLMs能够从丰富的多维反馈中学习，从二元奖励进展到序数奖励，并进一步向更密集的每步监督发展。

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

Method: 开发博弈论实验的数字孪生，引入系统化提示和探测框架进行机器行为评估，测试三个开源模型（Llama、Mistral和Qwen）。

Result: Llama能高保真复制人类合作模式，捕捉人类偏离理性选择理论的行为；Qwen与纳什均衡预测紧密对齐；无需基于角色的提示即可实现群体级行为复制。

Conclusion: 适当校准的LLM可以复制人类行为模式，并能系统探索未开发的实验空间，为社会科学研究提供补充方法，生成关于人类社交决策的新经验预测。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

### [66] [Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584)
*Daniel Gomm,Cornelius Wolff,Madelon Hulsebos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出将自然语言查询中的歧义视为合作交互的特征而非缺陷，开发了一个区分可解决的合作查询与不可解决的非合作查询的框架，并分析了15个流行数据集中的查询类型混合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言界面处理表格数据时需要处理查询中的固有歧义，作者认为不应将歧义视为缺陷，而应将其重新定义为合作交互的特征，让用户和系统共同承担查询规范的责任。

Method: 开发了一个原则性框架来区分合作查询（可解决的解释）和非合作查询（无法解决的查询），并将该框架应用于表格问答和分析的评估中，分析了15个流行数据集中的查询。

Result: 发现在这些数据集中存在查询类型的无控制混合，既不适合评估系统的执行准确性，也不适合评估解释能力。

Conclusion: 该框架和分析将视角从修复歧义转向在解决查询中拥抱合作，为表格数据的自然语言界面提供了更明智的设计和评估方法，并概述了未来研究的方向和影响。

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于合理代表（JR）概念的审计框架，用于衡量专家问答环节中问题选择的代表性，并开发了高效的审计算法。通过比较人工选择、优化算法和LLM生成的问题，评估了不同方法在代表性方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在公民大会等审议过程中，参与者只能提出有限数量的问题给专家小组，如何选择最具代表性的问题子集成为一个重要挑战。

Method: 引入基于合理代表（JR）概念的审计框架，开发了在通用效用设置下审计JR的算法，最有效算法的时间复杂度为O(mn log n)。比较了人工选择、整数线性规划优化和LLM生成的问题的代表性。

Result: 应用审计方法于历史审议数据，评估了不同问题选择方法的代表性表现，揭示了LLM在支持审议过程中的潜力和当前局限性。

Conclusion: 通过将审计方法集成到已在50多个国家使用的在线审议平台中，使实践者能够轻松审计和改进未来审议中的代表性。

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

### [68] [DR. WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04646)
*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DR.WELL是一个去中心化的神经符号框架，用于协作多智能体规划。它通过两阶段协商协议实现合作：智能体首先提出候选角色并进行推理，然后在共识和环境约束下承诺联合分配。承诺后，每个智能体独立生成并执行其角色的符号计划，无需透露详细轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作多智能体规划需要在部分信息和有限通信下做出联合决策。轨迹级协调常常失败，因为时间或运动中的微小偏差会级联成冲突。符号规划通过提高抽象级别和提供最小动作词汇表来缓解这一挑战，实现同步和集体进展。

Method: 采用两阶段协商协议：1）智能体提出候选角色并推理；2）在共识和环境约束下承诺联合分配。承诺后，智能体独立生成符号计划，通过共享世界模型进行执行。世界模型编码当前状态并随智能体行动更新。

Result: 在协作推块任务上的实验表明，智能体能够跨情景适应，动态世界模型捕获可重用模式，提高了任务完成率和效率。通过协商和自我优化，以时间开销换取演化、更高效的协作策略。

Conclusion: 通过符号规划而非原始轨迹推理，DR.WELL避免了脆弱的步骤级对齐，实现了可重用、可同步和可解释的更高层次操作。神经符号方法为协作多智能体规划提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

*Yu Feng,Nathaniel Weir,Kaj Bostrom,Sam Bayless,Darion Cassel,Sapana Chaudhary,Benjamin Kiesl-Reiter,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriCoT是一个神经符号方法，通过将思维链推理步骤形式化为一阶逻辑，使用自动求解器验证逻辑有效性，从而识别有缺陷的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然能进行多步推理，但无法可靠验证自身逻辑，即使在得出正确答案时，底层推理也可能存在缺陷，这在高风险场景中削弱了可信度。

Method: VeriCoT从思维链推理中提取形式逻辑论证，将每个推理步骤形式化为一阶逻辑，识别基于源上下文、常识知识或先前推理步骤的前提，使用符号表示实现自动验证。

Result: 在ProofWriter、LegalBench和BioASQ数据集上的实验表明，VeriCoT能有效识别有缺陷的推理，并作为最终答案正确性的强预测指标。

Conclusion: VeriCoT的验证信号可用于推理时自我反思、监督微调和偏好微调，进一步提高了推理的有效性和准确性。

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个联邦学习框架，用于物联网医疗环境中的隐私保护心电图分类，通过将1D ECG信号转换为2D GAF图像，使用CNN进行特征提取，在保持数据本地化的同时实现高效分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物联网医疗环境中ECG分类的隐私保护问题，同时应对异构设备部署的挑战，实现安全可扩展的边缘智能医疗监测。

Method: 将1D ECG信号转换为2D GAF图像，采用CNN进行特征提取，构建联邦学习框架在服务器、笔记本电脑和资源受限的Raspberry Pi 4等异构设备上部署。

Result: FL-GAF模型在多客户端设置中达到95.18%的分类准确率，显著优于单客户端基线，在准确率和训练时间上均有优势，同时保持高效的资源利用和通信开销。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了轻量级、隐私保护的AI在物联网医疗监测中的潜力，支持智能健康系统中可扩展且安全的边缘部署。

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for
privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things
(IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian
Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature
extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that
sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the
first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across
heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication
efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the
framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,
reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of
95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client
baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational
complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource
utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential
of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring,
supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

TL;DR: LOLGORITHM是一个用于短视频评论生成的模块化多智能体系统，支持六种不同评论风格，通过多模态大语言模型直接处理视频输入，在抖音和YouTube平台上获得超过90%和87.55%的用户偏好率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台已成为现代互联网的核心媒介，评论在促进社区参与和内容再创作中发挥关键作用，但生成既符合平台规范又具有风格多样性和上下文感知的评论仍是一个重大挑战。

Method: 采用模块化多智能体系统，集成视频分割、上下文和情感分析、风格感知提示构建，支持六种评论风格（双关语、押韵、表情包应用、讽刺、普通幽默、内容提取），使用多模态大语言模型直接处理视频输入。

Result: 构建了双语数据集，结合自动指标和大型人类偏好研究评估，结果显示LOLGORITHM显著优于基线模型，在抖音和YouTube上的偏好率分别超过90%和87.55%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为短视频平台上的风格化评论生成提供了一个可扩展和文化适应的框架，为增强用户参与度和创意互动提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet
landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are
reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms
of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community
participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments
that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting
stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.
We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for
controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video
segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt
construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),
rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content
extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM
directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through
explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and
evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin
(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy
skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk
shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style
conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and
105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms
baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on
YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for
stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path
to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多模态语义扰动的新方法来检测视觉语言模型中的测试集污染问题，该方法通过观察模型在受控扰动下的泛化能力来识别污染模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型使用互联网规模的预训练语料库，存在测试集泄漏导致性能虚高的问题，而现有的检测方法要么完全失效，要么表现不一致，需要开发有效的污染检测方法。

Method: 首先故意污染开源视觉语言模型，然后提出基于多模态语义扰动的检测方法，通过观察模型在受控扰动下的泛化能力来识别污染模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种现实污染策略下都能有效检测污染模型，证明了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态语义扰动方法能够有效检测视觉语言模型中的测试集污染问题，为模型评估提供了可靠的检测工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

TL;DR: FusionDP是一个特征级差分隐私框架，通过利用基础模型估算敏感特征，在保护敏感特征隐私的同时显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DP-SGD对所有特征统一施加隐私保护，导致过度噪声注入和效用下降。现实中不同特征的隐私敏感度不同，需要更细粒度的隐私保护方法。

Method: 采用两步框架：1) 使用基础模型基于非敏感特征估算敏感特征作为外部先验；2) 改进的DP-SGD算法在原始特征和估算特征上训练模型，同时保护原始敏感特征的隐私。

Result: 在PhysioNet败血症预测和MIMIC-III临床笔记分类任务上，FusionDP相比隐私保护基线显著提升了模型性能，同时保持了严格的特征级隐私保护。

Conclusion: FusionDP证明了基础模型驱动的估算方法能够有效改善各种模态数据的隐私-效用权衡。

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

Motivation: 推理语言模型在复杂任务上表现良好，但由于模型规模和长推理轨迹导致部署成本高昂。

Method: 使用s1.1-32B的中间表示训练轻量级预测器，预测问题难度或模型正确性，指导在推理模型池中的路由分配。

Result: 在多样化数学基准测试中，路由方法相比随机分配提高了效率，匹配s1.1-32B的性能同时显著减少计算量。

Conclusion: 难度感知路由对于推理模型的成本效益部署是有效的。

Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to
deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing
approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it,
reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate
representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem
difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning
models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random
assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less
compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线到在线强化学习中的分布偏移问题，现有方法很少明确评估或利用离线数据本身的分布结构，需要适应不同类型样本的学习策略。

Method: 提出Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff)方法：使用扩散模型从离线数据学习先验知识，通过能量函数改进策略模仿，生成离线类动作；计算生成动作与采样动作的KL散度，将训练批次分层为离线类和在线类样本，分别采用不同的学习目标。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试上的广泛实证评估表明，StratDiff与Cal-QL和IQL集成后显著优于现有方法，实现了增强的适应性和更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: StratDiff方法通过显式利用离线数据的分布结构，有效缓解了离线到在线强化学习中的分布偏移问题，为不同样本类型提供定制化学习策略，显著提升性能表现。

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

Motivation: 现实世界中的许多过程都表现出高阶机制，但因果发现中对交互作用的显式处理一直很少受到关注。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 扩展因果加性模型(CAM)到包含高阶交互作用的加性模型，使用有向无环超图表示结构，开发了贪婪CAM算法的扩展来处理超DAG搜索空间。

Result: 提供了超DAG的可识别性结果，扩展了典型的马尔可夫等价类，并证明了学习更复杂的超图结构可能带来更好的经验结果。

Conclusion: 更严格的假设如CAM对应于更容易学习的超DAG和更好的有限样本复杂度，开发的算法在合成实验中显示出实用价值。

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

TL;DR: 本文提出SADQ方法，通过显式建模环境动态和集成后继状态分布来改进DQN，解决了传统DQN中目标更新依赖过时策略导致的高方差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DQN从回放缓冲区采样转换进行学习，但目标更新依赖于过去可能次优策略生成的下一个状态，这些状态可能无法提供有效的学习信号，导致更新过程的高方差。当采样的转换与智能体当前策略不一致时，问题更加严重。

Method: 提出Successor-state Aggregation Deep Q-Network (SADQ)，使用随机转移模型显式建模环境动态，将后继状态分布集成到Q值估计过程中，实现更稳定和策略对齐的值更新。同时探索基于建模转移结构的更高效动作选择策略。

Result: 理论保证SADQ在减少训练方差的同时保持无偏值估计。在标准RL基准测试和现实世界向量控制任务中的广泛实证结果表明，SADQ在稳定性和学习效率方面始终优于DQN变体。

Conclusion: SADQ通过显式建模环境动态和集成后继状态分布，有效解决了DQN中由策略不匹配引起的高方差问题，提供了更稳定和高效的学习方法。

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that
SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our
extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world
vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN
variants in both stability and learning efficiency.

Motivation: 社交和协作平台产生多元时间序列数据，其中早期互动与后期高影响结果之间存在时间延迟的相关性，但缺乏标准化的数据集和统一的预测方法框架。

Method: 构建了两个大规模基准数据集（arXiv的访问量→引用量，GitHub的推送/星标→分支数），并提出了参数化和非参数化基线回归方法进行基准测试。

early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads
and documentation is available at https://lead-lag-forecasting.github.io/.

### [79] [DecoHD: Decomposed Hyperdimensional Classification under Extreme Memory Budgets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03911)
*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O. We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end, yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC, aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters, and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU (AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x over a baseline HDC ASIC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to apply decomposition techniques to hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to achieve memory footprint reduction without compromising performance. Traditional HDC compression methods shrink the feature axis, which degrades concentration and robustness. The authors aim to develop a decomposition approach that preserves HDC's native operations while enabling extreme memory savings.

Method: The paper introduces DecoHD, which learns directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization. It uses a small, shared set of per-layer channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end. This approach compresses along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native bind-bundle-score operations. Training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC, making it compatible with in/near-memory accelerators.

Result: DeccoHD achieves extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation. On average, it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%). It demonstrates improved robustness to random bit-flip noise, reaches accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters, and delivers significant hardware performance gains: 277x/35x energy/speed improvements over CPU, 13.5x/3.7x over GPU, and 2.0x/2.4x over baseline HDC ASIC.

Conclusion: DeccoHD successfully applies decomposition to hyperdimensional computing, enabling extreme memory compression while maintaining high accuracy and robustness. The method preserves HDC's native operations and aligns well with in/near-memory accelerators, demonstrating significant energy and speed improvements across different hardware platforms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从移动数据推断社会人口属性的方法，通过引入基于有向移动图的行为特征、不确定性量化工具和多任务学习框架，提高了预测准确性、可解释性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从移动数据推断社会人口属性有助于交通规划，但由于移动模式与社会人口特征关系弱且不一致，以及跨情境泛化能力有限，这一任务仍然困难。

Method: 1) 引入基于有向移动图的高阶移动描述符；2) 开发模型置信度与准确性均衡的度量和可视化诊断工具；3) 构建多任务学习框架，从共享表示中联合预测多个社会人口属性。

Result: 新特征显著提高了年龄、性别、收入和家庭结构预测的准确性；多任务学习框架在训练数据有限或测试集分布不同时优于单任务模型；诊断工具能够有效量化不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过行为基础特征、不确定性量化和多任务学习，有效解决了从移动数据推断社会人口属性的挑战，为交通规划提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

### [82] [LogHD: Robust Compression of Hyperdimensional Classifiers via Logarithmic Class-Axis Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03938)
*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Pietro Mercati,Nathaniel D. Bastian,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogHD是一种超维计算压缩方法，通过对类别轴进行对数压缩，将内存需求从O(CD)降低到O(Dlog_k C)，同时保持维度D不变，在保持竞争力的准确率下实现更高的容错性和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准超维计算的"每个类别一个原型"设计需要O(CD)内存，限制了其在内存、能耗和可靠性受限系统中的应用。现有的特征轴压缩方法虽然减少了存储和计算需求，但会削弱鲁棒性。

Method: LogHD采用对数类别轴压缩，用n≈⌈log_k C⌉个捆绑超向量替换C个每类原型，在n维激活空间中进行解码。使用容量感知码本和基于配置文件的解码方法，并与特征轴稀疏化相结合。

Result: 在多个数据集和注入比特翻转的情况下，LogHD在较小模型下实现了竞争力的准确率，在相同内存下比特征轴压缩方法能承受2.5-3.0倍的比特翻转率。ASIC实现相比AMD Ryzen 9 9950X实现了498倍能效和62.6倍加速，相比NVIDIA RTX 4090实现了24.3倍/6.58倍提升，相比特征轴HDC ASIC基线能效提升4.06倍，速度提升2.19倍。

Conclusion: LogHD提供了一种有效的超维计算压缩方法，在显著减少内存需求的同时保持了模型的鲁棒性和性能，特别适合资源受限的边缘计算系统。

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and
reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class"
design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior
compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening
robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that
replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$
bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional
activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD
uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with
feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD
attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at
matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly
$2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC
instantiation delivers $498\times$ energy efficiency and $62.6\times$ speedup
over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and $24.3\times$/$6.58\times$ over an NVIDIA RTX
4090, and is $4.06\times$ more energy-efficient and $2.19\times$ faster than a
feature-axis HDC ASIC baseline.

Motivation: 解决马尔可夫过程中未知转移核的快速变化检测问题，特别是在高维数据场景下避免显式似然评估的困难。

Method: 直接从样本对学习条件分数∇_y log p(y|x)，开发基于分数的CUSUM程序，使用条件Hyvarinen分数差异检测核变化，并提出截断统计量确保有界增量。

Result: 证明了均匀遍历马尔可夫过程的误报时间指数下界和检测延迟的渐近上界，为高维马尔可夫模型中的分数检测提供了理论保证。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维马尔可夫模型中的变化检测提供了理论保证和实际可行性，避免了显式似然评估的复杂性。

Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with
unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score
$\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs
$( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are
high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we
avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the
transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM
procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes
in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of
the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov
processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm.
We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give
both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection
in high-dimensional Markov models.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，HIF在关键指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HIF为认知诊断模型响应用户数据删除请求提供了首个有效解决方案，有助于部署高性能、隐私保护的AI系统。

Abstract: The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models
has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and
for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SARS-CoV-2的快速进化轨迹和免疫逃逸变体的持续出现对公共卫生和疫苗开发构成挑战，而现有大规模生成预训练Transformer直接应用于嘈杂的病毒基因组序列存在局限性。

Method: 提出PETRA方法，基于系统发育树推导的进化轨迹而非原始RNA序列，采用加权训练框架解决全球序列数据的地理和时间不平衡问题。

Result: PETRA在预测SARS-CoV-2未来突变方面表现优异，核苷酸突变的加权recall@1达到9.45%，刺突蛋白氨基酸突变为17.10%，显著优于基线方法的0.49%和6.64%。

Conclusion: PETRA能够有效预测SARS-CoV-2的未来突变，包括主要分支如24F(XEC)和25A(LP.8.1)的实时突变预测，为病毒进化监测提供有力工具。

Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra

Abstract: This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph
structural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost
and structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in
multi-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model
dependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and
paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural
constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters
are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable
mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior
guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training
stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in
multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,
environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically
analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and
relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior
performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,
adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while
maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages
of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.

Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds
obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by
insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This
review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable
technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic
phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage
high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance
tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell
function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,
where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to
standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus
grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,
integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical
activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with
specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.
The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be
phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can
deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable
subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the
way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies
tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for
a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

control, while also considering limited data scenarios and noisy measurements.
We introduce a common task framework (CTF) for science and engineering, which
features a growing collection of challenge data sets with a diverse set of
practical and common objectives. The CTF is a critically enabling technology
that has contributed to the rapid advance of ML/AI algorithms in traditional
applications such as speech recognition, language processing, and computer
vision. There is a critical need for the objective metrics of a CTF to compare
the diverse algorithms being rapidly developed and deployed in practice today
across science and engineering.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对边缘设备LLM部署的自回归感知分割计算框架，通过混合精度量化、两阶段中间压缩和联合优化，在保持精度的同时显著降低通信开销和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在资源受限的物联网设备上部署不切实际，现有分割计算方法无法解决自回归推理的独特挑战，特别是迭代令牌生成过程和不断扩展的键值缓存需求。

Result: 在多种LLM和硬件平台上评估显示，相比SmoothQuant、OmniQuant和Atom等最先进量化方法，该框架实现了1.49倍推理加速和显著通信开销降低，同时保持或提高了模型精度。

Conclusion: 该自回归感知分割计算框架为资源受限边缘设备上的LLM部署提供了实用解决方案，在满足严格内存和延迟约束的同时实现了高效推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework
achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead
reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Conclusion: DartQuant使大语言模型量化在资源受限环境中变得可行，为大规模模型的高效量化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of
large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively
improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end
fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational
costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an
efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which
reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the
distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively
reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of
overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which
replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In
a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior
performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration
and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.
Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration
for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language
models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at

Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute
abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians
due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to
develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet
architecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We
used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound
scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted
with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each
subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,
appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based
classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from
non-appendicitis cases. Images were preprocessed by normalization, resizing,
and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved
an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8,
demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across
heterogeneous ultrasound views. The model effectively learned discriminative
spatial features, overcoming challenges posed by low contrast, speckle noise,
and anatomical variability in pediatric imaging.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种学习数据驱动权重的方法来解决过滤近似最近邻搜索问题，通过约束线性优化学习向量距离和过滤匹配之间的最优权衡，相比固定惩罚方法显著提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图的方法使用固定的、与数据无关的惩罚来整合过滤意识，但由于标签和向量分布的多样性，这些方法往往无法在不同数据集上泛化。

Method: 将过滤ANN搜索问题建模为约束线性优化问题，直接从数据中学习向量距离和过滤匹配之间的最优权衡权重，这些学习到的权重指导搜索过程和索引构建。

Result: 实验表明，与固定惩罚方法相比，将距离函数适应数据的方法显著提高了5-10%的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为过滤ANN搜索问题提供了一个更灵活和可泛化的框架，通过数据驱动的权重学习更好地捕捉底层过滤分布和过滤语义。

Abstract: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest
vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of
discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each
retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter
awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter
satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent
penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and
vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that
learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly
from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a
constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect
the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered
ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and
index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture
the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments
demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-
proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible
and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.

TL;DR: 该研究构建了韩国避税面板(KoTaP)，这是一个包含2011-2024年韩国KOSPI和KOSDAQ上市非金融企业的长期面板数据集，共12,653个公司年度观测值。数据集将企业避税作为预测变量，关联到盈余管理、盈利能力、稳定性、增长性和治理等多个领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个标准化的韩国企业避税研究数据集，既保持与国际文献的可比性，又反映韩国特有的制度特征，为会计、金融和跨学科研究提供开放资源。

Method: 从韩国KOSPI和KOSDAQ市场筛选非金融企业，排除非12月财年结束、资本减损和税前利润为负的企业，最终形成平衡面板数据集。使用现金有效税率(CETR)、GAAP有效税率(GETR)和账面税收差异(TSTA、TSDA)等互补指标衡量避税程度。

Result: 成功构建了包含12,653个公司年度观测值的KoTaP数据集，具有平衡面板结构、标准化变量，并验证了核心指标分布和相关性与国际文献的一致性，同时体现了韩国企业所有权集中、外资持股高、流动性比率高等独有特征。

Conclusion: KoTaP是一个重要的开放研究资源，支持计量经济学和深度学习模型基准测试、外部有效性检验、可解释AI分析，以及政策评估、审计规划和投资分析等应用。

Abstract: This study introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term
panel dataset of non-financial firms listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ between 2011
and 2024. After excluding financial firms, firms with non-December fiscal year
ends, capital impairment, and negative pre-tax income, the final dataset
consists of 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms. KoTaP is designed
to treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to
multiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based),
profitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE,
INVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance
itself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate
(CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA,
TSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is
its balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency
with international literature on the distribution and correlation of core
indicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of
Korean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and
elevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and
contextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric
and deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI
analyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment
analysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and
interdisciplinary research.

Conclusion: 该方法能够一致地学习与原始数学结构匹配的表达式，而其他方法无法做到这一点。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical
expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However,
most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the
governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions.
To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates
interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic
algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable
SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical
expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method
employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic
skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's
response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a
GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before
incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves
their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo
coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with
controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable
interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three
neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach
consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical
structure.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) technology has shown
substantial advantages across various domains. As critical system software and
infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into
target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development
and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely
unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and
its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework
specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code
comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed
various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and
evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently
achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the
model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code
generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we
maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural
designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training,
knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential
to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field
of compilation.

Method: EPO通过迭代求解有限约束安全RL子问题，采用约束扩展和删除机制自适应调整活动集：违反预定义容差的约束被添加以细化策略，更新后拉格朗日乘子为零的约束被移除。

Result: 理论分析表明，在温和假设下，通过EPO训练的策略实现了与最优解相当的性能，同时全局约束违反严格保持在预定界限内。

Conclusion: EPO框架有效解决了半无限安全强化学习问题，通过交换规则控制工作集增长，支持有效的策略训练，确保安全约束的有界性。

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements
while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications,
however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as
semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when
safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space,
such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In
this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic
framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded
safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite
constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint
expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations
exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those
with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This
exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports
effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under
mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to
optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a
prescribed bound.

Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating
Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional
airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine
learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or
"what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models
trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce
airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and
flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their
transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory
datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying
amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that
diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of
the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently
outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual
inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from
pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show
weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory
patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to
substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,
enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited
historical records.

Abstract: This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to
address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,
large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes
multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to
achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A
learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic
evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head
self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal
sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic
representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign
adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability
of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates
individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in
accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk
identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an
efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model
performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed
by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly
tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the
impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping
on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we
propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise
between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training.
Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or
improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across
different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and
joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout
strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings
provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize
deep ensemble models. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 本文对MXFP4格式下的后训练量化方法进行了系统评估，发现GPTQ等方法表现良好，而基于旋转的方法与MXFP4存在严重不兼容。通过分析发现根本原因是MXFP4的PoT块缩放与全局旋转的能量重分配不匹配，并提出了一种有效的块旋转策略来改进性能。

Motivation: 大语言模型规模快速增长带来了巨大的内存、计算和能源成本，后训练量化是高效部署的解决方案。但现有方法主要针对INT4格式，而新兴的MXFP4格式的适用性尚不明确，需要系统评估和适配。

Method: 建立MXFP4格式下PTQ方法的综合基准，系统评估不同方法的性能。通过深入分析发现旋转方法与MXFP4不兼容的根本原因，并提出块旋转策略来适配基于旋转的方法。

Result: 评估发现GPTQ等方法在MXFP4下表现稳定，而基于旋转的方法性能严重下降。提出的块旋转策略显著提高了基于旋转方法在MXFP4格式下的准确率，在多种LLM上都取得了实质性改进。

Conclusion: 研究为从业者提供了MXFP4格式下PTQ方法的明确指导，并为新兴低精度格式下的PTQ研究奠定了基础。提出的块旋转策略有效解决了旋转方法与MXFP4的兼容性问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their
rapidly growing scale imposes prohibitive costs in memory, computation, and
energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient
deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge.
While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of
MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)--
raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work,
we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format.
Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently
deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost
used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility
with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict,
tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two)
block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation
strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial
accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear
guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research
under emerging low-precision formats.

Conclusion: 成功将强彩票票证假设扩展到多头注意力机制和Transformer架构，为理解这些架构的初始化特性提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) conjectures that high-performing
subnetworks, called strong lottery tickets (SLTs), are hidden in randomly
initialized neural networks. Although recent theoretical studies have
established the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for
transformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,
the current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head
attention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this
gap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.
We prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension
$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it
contains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input
dimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for
MHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We
empirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the
approximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)
and an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the
hidden dimension of the source model.

TL;DR: seqme是一个用于评估生物序列设计计算方法的开源Python库，提供序列、嵌入和属性三类模型无关的指标，适用于多种生物序列类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生物序列设计计算方法的发展，需要统一的软件库来实现评估这些方法性能的指标，但目前缺乏这样的工具。

Method: 开发seqme库，包含序列基础、嵌入基础和属性基础三类模型无关的指标，提供多种嵌入和属性模型，以及诊断和可视化功能。

Result: 成功创建了模块化、高度可扩展的seqme库，能够评估一次性设计和迭代计算设计方法。

Conclusion: seqme填补了生物序列设计评估工具的空缺，为研究人员提供了统一的评估框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in computational methods for designing biological sequences
have sparked the development of metrics to evaluate these methods performance
in terms of the fidelity of the designed sequences to a target distribution and
their attainment of desired properties. However, a single software library
implementing these metrics was lacking. In this work we introduce seqme, a
modular and highly extendable open-source Python library, containing
model-agnostic metrics for evaluating computational methods for biological
sequence design. seqme considers three groups of metrics: sequence-based,
embedding-based, and property-based, and is applicable to a wide range of
biological sequences: small molecules, DNA, ncRNA, mRNA, peptides and proteins.
The library offers a number of embedding and property models for biological
sequences, as well as diagnostics and visualization functions to inspect the
results. seqme can be used to evaluate both one-shot and iterative
computational design methods.

TL;DR: STELLE是一个神经符号框架，通过将时间序列直接嵌入到时序逻辑概念空间中，统一了分类和解释功能，提供可解释的时序分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序分类在安全关键应用中很重要，但通常使用黑盒深度学习方法，难以理解其输出原理。需要开发既能保持竞争力又能提供人类可理解解释的方法。

Method: 提出STELLE框架，引入基于信号时序逻辑(STL)的新核函数，将原始时间序列映射到与预定义STL公式的对齐程度，联合优化准确性和可解释性。

Result: 实验证明STELLE在保持竞争力的准确性的同时，提供逻辑上忠实的解释，在多个真实世界基准测试中得到验证。

Conclusion: STELLE成功实现了时序分类与解释的统一，为安全关键应用提供了既准确又可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for
Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that
unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories
into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired
kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL
formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each
prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that
characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL
conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as
class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves
competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated
on diverse real-world benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合RLHF可扩展性和PBO样本效率的混合框架，通过在RLHF流程中集成主动查询模块来实现高效偏好数据收集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类偏好中学习是使机器学习模型与人类主观判断对齐的关键，但收集偏好数据成本高昂且耗时，需要更高效的学习范式。

Method: 将主动查询驱动的模块集成到RLHF流程中，结合RLHF的可扩展性和PBO的样本效率优势。

Result: 在高维偏好优化和LLM微调两个代表性领域的实验结果表明，该方法在样本效率和整体性能上均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架成功统一了RLHF的可扩展性和PBO的查询效率，为高效偏好学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning
models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is
often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient
learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages:
RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning,
while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We
propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query
efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline,
thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate
the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional
preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall
performance across these tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私上下文学习方法忽视了现代大语言模型流程中的关键组件——用于检索相关上下文数据的相似性搜索，这带来了隐私风险。

Method: 采用最近邻检索从上下文数据数据库中获取相关示例，结合隐私过滤器跟踪选定样本的累积隐私成本，确保符合中心差分隐私预算。

Result: 在文本分类和文档问答任务上的实验结果显示，该方法在所有评估基准上都显著优于现有基线，实现了更优的隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: 所提出的差分隐私上下文学习框架通过整合隐私感知的最近邻搜索，在保护隐私的同时大幅提升了模型性能，为隐私保护机器学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an
active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning.
However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large
language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant
context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning
that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware
manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin
across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility
trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a
database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the
cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central
differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and
document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over
existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易依赖虚假相关性，在分布偏移下表现脆弱，特别是在子群体偏移场景中，模型在代表性不足群体上表现不佳。现有方法缺乏连接嵌入空间表示与最差群体误差的理论框架。

Method: 提出SCER方法，通过理论分析识别虚假方向和核心方向，在嵌入层面对特征表示施加正则化约束，抑制模型对虚假模式的敏感性。

Result: 在多个视觉和语言任务上的系统评估表明，SCER在最差群体准确率上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SCER通过直接正则化嵌入空间表示，有效提升模型在最差群体上的鲁棒性，为缓解虚假相关性问题提供了理论指导的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but
often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution
shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,
where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have
made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still
constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the
embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this
limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for
Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes
feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that
worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on
spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean
embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at
the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while
reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on
multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior
state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy. Our code is available at

Result: 当前不确定性估计器在无模糊假设下表现良好，但在模糊数据上性能降至接近随机水平。这种现象在不同估计范式中一致存在，预测分布和集成方法在模糊性下存在根本局限性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLM不确定性量化方法的关键缺陷，需要重新思考当前建模范式，开发能够有效处理语言模糊性的不确定性量化方法。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently
ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically
benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that
while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive
assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on
ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first
ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer
distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance
deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the
predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,
and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically
explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators
are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key
shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of
current modeling paradigms.

Motivation: 重尾噪声在非凸随机优化中日益受到关注，因为大量实证研究表明它比标准有界方差假设更符合现实情况。本文旨在解决联邦学习中重尾梯度噪声下的极小极大优化问题。

Method: 提出了两种新算法：1) Fed-NSGDA-M算法，集成归一化梯度技术；2) FedMuon-DA算法，利用Muon优化器进行局部更新。两种算法都专门设计用于有效处理联邦极小极大优化中的重尾噪声。

Result: 理论分析表明，两种算法都达到了O(1/(TNp)^((s-1)/2s))的收敛速率。据作者所知，这是首个在重尾噪声下具有严格理论保证的联邦极小极大优化算法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Fed-NSGDA-M和FedMuon-DA算法在重尾噪声条件下有效解决了联邦学习中的非凸-PL极小极大优化问题，并通过大量实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise has attracted growing attention in nonconvex stochastic
optimization, as numerous empirical studies suggest it offers a more realistic
assumption than standard bounded variance assumption. In this work, we
investigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise
in federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which
integrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon
optimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively
address heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder
condition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with
rigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Extensive experiments
further validate their effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有市场生成器缺乏因果推理能力，无法进行有效的反事实分析和风险评估，需要开发能够保持时间依赖性和因果关系的生成模型。

Method: 使用变分自编码器与结构因果模型结合，在解码器架构中通过有向无环图施加因果约束，并采用因果Wasserstein距离进行训练。

Result: 在基于Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程的合成自回归模型上验证，反事实概率估计的L1距离低至0.03-0.10，优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 该模型能够生成尊重基础因果机制的反事实市场轨迹，支持金融压力测试、情景分析和增强回测能力。

Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for
synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal
reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk
assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that
combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate
counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal
dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints
through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the
causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic
autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating
superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances
as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial
stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating
plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal
mechanisms.

Abstract: Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a
promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various
solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the
lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval.
We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic
Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing
the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We
show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG
retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better
models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset
designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with
respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular
solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.

<details>

Motivation: 算法公平性研究快速发展，但关键概念在刑事司法领域仍存在争议，特别是不同公平性概念之间的冲突问题需要解决。

Method: 开发了标准群体公平性的简单修改方法：不要求受保护群体间的精确平等，而是最小化加权错误损失，同时将假阴性率差异控制在较小容忍范围内。

Result: 该方法使解决方案更容易找到，可以提高预测准确性，并突显错误成本的道德选择。

Conclusion: 提出了基于三个支柱的实用部署框架：基于需求的决策、透明度和问责制、以及精确定义和解决方案，将技术设计与合法性联系起来，为使用风险评估工具的机构提供可操作指导。

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts
remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual,
and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then
develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact
parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping
differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes
solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the
ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of
critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the
explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for
deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based
decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions
and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and
provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related
tools.

Motivation: 研究LMC在数据偏移条件下的表现，探索如何减轻数据偏移对深度学习模型训练的影响，理解LMC在模型收敛、平滑性和泛化性方面的作用。

Method: 将数据偏移解释为随机梯度噪声的额外来源，通过实验研究学习率和批量大小对LMC的影响，分析模型收敛到相同局部最小值或不同损失景观区域的条件。

Result: 小学习率和大批量大小可以减少数据偏移的影响，LMC模型倾向于产生相似错误，但LMC在训练效率和多样化集成收益之间提供了平衡。

Conclusion: LMC在数据偏移下仍然有效，通过适当调整学习率和批量大小可以减轻数据偏移的负面影响，LMC有助于平衡训练效率与模型多样性需求。

Abstract: The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of
deep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients,
the smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and
functional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data
processing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and
identify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an
additional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through
small learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether
models converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape
with varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC
tend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different
basins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the
gains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles. Code and supplementary
materials will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DLR-KI/LMC in

Conclusion: 该方法为潜在空间降阶模型提供了一种灵活、通用的不确定性量化框架，无需修改模型架构或训练过程。

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional
physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing
approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits
flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic
framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that
requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure.
Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction
intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics,
reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a
latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately
predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty
across the ROM pipeline.

<details>

Motivation: 现有图模型主要关注空间结构，将时间信息仅作为过滤约束而非建模信号，且通常为单任务预测设计，无法满足医疗、金融等领域的复杂时空交互和多任务需求。

Result: 在RelBench、SALT和CTU数据集上的实验表明，RGP实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RGP为关系深度学习提供了一个通用且可扩展的解决方案，支持多样化的预测任务。

Abstract: In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics
of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between
patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be
broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range
spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also
supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for
relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal
information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather
than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.
To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances
global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture
temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph
Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning
that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently
integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent
bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common
latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire
relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder
that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a
single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers
state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for
relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.

Motivation: 保护生物学面临的关键挑战是缺乏物种出现数据，而现有文献中的这些数据往往不是机器可读的，需要大量人工工作来提取。

Method: 开发了ARETE R包，利用chatGPT API实现物种出现数据的自动化提取和验证，包括光学字符识别、异常值检测和表格输出等完整流程。

Result: 对100种蜘蛛物种的测试显示，自动提取的数据使已知分布范围平均扩大了三个数量级，揭示了新的历史分布区域。

Conclusion: ARETE能够快速获取未被利用的出现数据，使研究人员能够更好地分配资源，在项目规划期间预测可用的文献数据。

Abstract: 1. A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is
our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore,
researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information
must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications
ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial
information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive
human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source
software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by
large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming
Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and
validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers
and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic
comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced
using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of
spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence
by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were
found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial
conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster
access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in
projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize
resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated
extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available
bibliographic data during project planning.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics
and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to
achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a
natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While
the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent
settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized
multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the
transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying
novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.
Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on
the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our
regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the
inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning
complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of
efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 探索智能体在环境无关的方式下自主选择目标来学习解决任务的可能性，实现无需外部指导的强化学习训练。

Method: 将常规强化学习环境转换为目标条件环境，使用与底层离策略学习算法无关的方法，让智能体自主选择目标进行训练。

Result: 智能体能够在与外部指导强化学习相当的训练时间内学习解决任务，平均目标成功率得到改善和稳定，但单个目标的性能存在不稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法使智能体能够被指示寻求环境中的任何观测，为特定用例之前的通用智能体训练提供了可能性。

Abstract: In this paper we study how transforming regular reinforcement learning
environments into goal-conditioned environments can let agents learn to solve
tasks autonomously and reward-free. We show that an agent can learn to solve
tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training
times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is
independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method
is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,
leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our
experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and
stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any
observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior
to specific use cases.

TL;DR: 本文研究了机制可解释性中因果干预技术是否会产生分布外表示，分析了无害和有害的分布差异，并提出了改进方法来减少有害差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究因果干预技术是否会产生分布外表示，以及这些表示是否会影响对目标模型自然状态下解释的忠实性。

Method: 首先实证验证常见因果干预技术会导致内部表示偏离自然分布，然后理论分析两类分布差异，最后改进CL损失函数来正则化干预。

Result: 发现常见因果干预技术确实会导致分布外表示，识别了无害和有害两类分布差异，改进的CL损失能有效减少有害差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发更可靠的可解释性方法提供了路径，强调了在保持干预解释力的同时减少有害分布差异的重要性。

Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate
model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what
those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create
out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises
concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target
model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common
causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away
from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a
theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences
that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within
behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate
hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an
effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent
(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to
the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while
preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results
highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

Motivation: 研究偏微分方程动力系统的概率预测技术，特别是减少流匹配范式中的采样步数，以提高预测效率。

Method: 比较直接蒸馏、渐进蒸馏、对抗扩散蒸馏、Wasserstein GANs和修正流等多种流匹配扩展方法。

Result: 在挑战性系统上进行实验，成功实现了直接预测大规模3D模拟的2D切片，为求解器的高效入流生成铺平了道路。

Conclusion: 多种流匹配扩展方法在减少采样步数方面具有潜力，能够有效应用于偏微分方程动力系统的概率预测，特别是为大规模3D模拟的2D切片预测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper is concerned with probabilistic techniques for forecasting
dynamical systems described by partial differential equations (such as, for
example, the Navier-Stokes equations). In particular, it is investigating and
comparing various extensions to the flow matching paradigm that reduce the
number of sampling steps. In this regard, it compares direct distillation,
progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs
and rectified flows. Moreover, experiments are conducted on a set of
challenging systems. In particular, we also address the challenge of directly
predicting 2D slices of large-scale 3D simulations, paving the way for
efficient inflow generation for solvers.

TL;DR: 本文研究了扩散语言模型（特别是掩码扩散模型MDM）的并行采样能力，通过函数逼近理论精确刻画了真实分布与采样分布之间的期望散度，并给出了基于信息论性质的新采样边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自回归语言模型的推理过程是顺序的，导致推理时间长且成本高。扩散语言模型能够并行采样，但对其并行采样能力缺乏严格理解。

Method: 通过建立与单变量函数逼近理论的联系，精确表征了真实分布与采样分布之间的期望散度，并基于信息论性质（总相关性和对偶总相关性）设计了新的采样边界和采样调度策略。

Result: 证明了在某些自然设置下，可以在O(log n)步内完成采样而不会出现性能损失，其中n是序列总长度。同时发现，在没有强先验知识的情况下，很难与最优解竞争。

Conclusion: 扩散语言模型在特定条件下可以实现高效的并行采样，但需要基于分布的信息论特性来设计采样策略，这为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that
their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and
costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of
language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion
model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens
out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,
there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling
these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling
performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but
these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we
give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true
distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any
unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory
of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and
upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation
in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show
that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori
knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we
also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of
well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,
its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some
natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss
in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.

TL;DR: 提出了一种灰盒、全三维的极端降水临近预报框架，直接处理体积雷达反射率数据，结合物理约束的神经算子和数据驱动学习，在3小时预报时效内实现更准确的降水预报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：数值天气预报及其深度学习模拟速度慢且分辨率低；外推法和纯数据驱动模型存在误差累积和过度平滑问题；基于2D雷达的混合方法丢弃了关键的垂直信息。

Method: 开发了全三维临近预报框架，学习垂直变化的3D平流场，参数化空间变化的扩散，引入布朗运动启发的随机项表示未解析运动，使用残差分支捕捉小尺度对流启动和微物理变化，并包含基于扩散的随机模块估计不确定性。

Result: 在3小时预报时效内对不同降水类型实现更准确预报，在160名气象学家的盲评中57%的情况下排名第一。

Conclusion: 通过恢复具有物理一致性的完整3D动力学，为极端降水的熟练可靠临近预报提供了可扩展且稳健的途径。

Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and
extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for
rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models
suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based
methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate
reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully
three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar
reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with
datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields
under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying
diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to
represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective
initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic
module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up
to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\%
of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D
dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for
skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

Motivation: 开发通用学习算法的一个基本挑战是它们在适应新数据时倾向于遗忘过去的知识。解决这个问题需要对遗忘有原则性的理解，但尽管经过数十年的研究，尚未出现能够洞察学习底层动态的统一定义。

Method: 提出了一个算法和任务无关的理论，将遗忘特征化为学习者在未来经验预测分布中缺乏自一致性，表现为预测信息的损失。该理论自然产生了一种衡量算法遗忘倾向的通用方法。为了验证该理论，设计了一套全面的实验，涵盖分类、回归、生成建模和强化学习。

Result: 经验证明遗忘存在于所有学习设置中，并在决定学习效率方面起着重要作用。

Conclusion: 这些结果建立了对遗忘的原则性理解，并为分析和改进通用学习算法的信息保留能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their
tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this
problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades
of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the
underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic
theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a
learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a
loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure
of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a
comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,
generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate
how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant
role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a
principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and
improving the information retention capabilities of general learning
algorithms.

TL;DR: 本研究通过结合经典测验理论、机器学习和无监督聚类的多方法框架，评估了198名学生参加的40项数学分班考试，发现多项改进机会，包括替换区分度差的题目、调整分班阈值等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数学分班考试可能存在评估不准确的问题，需要通过多方法整合来优化分班决策，提高评估的准确性和公平性。

Method: 采用经典测验理论分析题目区分度，结合机器学习算法（随机森林、梯度提升）进行预测，并使用K-means聚类识别学生能力结构。

Result: 55%的题目具有优秀区分度，30%需要替换；机器学习模型达到97.5%的交叉验证准确率；聚类发现42.5%的自然分班边界，与机构设定的55%阈值存在差异。

Conclusion: 多方法整合为数学分班优化提供了坚实的实证基础，建议替换区分度差的题目、实施两阶段评估，并整合随机森林预测与透明度机制。

Abstract: This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered
to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory,
machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis
reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \geq 0.40$)
while 30\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.
Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful
discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA
F-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance
(0.206), accounting for 20.6\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms
demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
achieving 97.5\% and 96.0\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering
identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\%,
diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\% and suggesting potential
overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits
exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster
purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:
replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and
integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These
findings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical
foundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.

Motivation: 软体机器人需要动态形状控制，但缺乏适用于控制的一般建模工具，因此需要研究数据驱动的模型降阶技术来生成适用于控制的线性模型。

Method: 比较研究三种数据驱动模型降阶方法：特征系统实现算法、带控制的动态模态分解和拉格朗日算子推断方法，并在模拟的鳗鱼仿生软体机器人上进行动态形状控制的模型预测控制策略评估。

Result: 在三个实验中（跟踪保证可行的模拟参考轨迹、跟踪生物鳗鱼运动学模型生成的参考轨迹、跟踪缩小比例物理模拟生成的参考轨迹），基于LOpInf的策略产生的跟踪误差都低于基于其他模型的策略。

Conclusion: LOpInf方法在软体机器人动态形状控制中表现最佳，为软体机器人控制提供了有效的模型降阶解决方案。

Abstract: Soft robots have shown immense promise in settings where they can leverage
dynamic control of their entire bodies. However, effective dynamic shape
control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional
dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for
modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a
comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating
linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three
methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with
control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each
class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies
for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three
experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be
feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model
of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a
reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies
generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.

Abstract: Humanoid soccer poses a representative challenge for embodied intelligence,
requiring robots to operate within a tightly coupled perception-action loop.
However, existing systems typically rely on decoupled modules, resulting in
delayed responses and incoherent behaviors in dynamic environments, while
real-world perceptual limitations further exacerbate these issues. In this
work, we present a unified reinforcement learning-based controller that enables
humanoid robots to acquire reactive soccer skills through the direct
integration of visual perception and motion control. Our approach extends
Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings in real-world dynamic
environments, bridging motion imitation and visually grounded dynamic control.
We introduce an encoder-decoder architecture combined with a virtual perception
system that models real-world visual characteristics, allowing the policy to
recover privileged states from imperfect observations and establish active
coordination between perception and action. The resulting controller
demonstrates strong reactivity, consistently executing coherent and robust
soccer behaviors across various scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.

Abstract: This paper introduces an upper limb postural optimization method for
enhancing physical ergonomics and force manipulability during bimanual
human-robot co-carrying tasks. Existing research typically emphasizes human
safety or manipulative efficiency, whereas our proposed method uniquely
integrates both aspects to strengthen collaboration across diverse conditions
(e.g., different grasping postures of humans, and different shapes of objects).
Specifically, the joint angles of a simplified human skeleton model are
optimized by minimizing the cost function to prioritize safety and manipulative
capability. To guide humans towards the optimized posture, the reference
end-effector poses of the robot are generated through a transformation module.
A bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) is proposed for our
human-like robot, CURI, to recalibrate the end effector poses through planned
trajectories. The proposed method has been validated through various subjects
and objects during human-human collaboration (HHC) and human-robot
collaboration (HRC). The experimental results demonstrate significant
improvement in muscle conditions by comparing the activation of target muscles
before and after optimization.

Motivation: 大规模灾难搜救行动面临复杂地形和通信中断的挑战，无人机群虽然提供了有前景的解决方案，但有效协调给人类操作员带来了显著的认知负担。核心的人机协作瓶颈在于"意图到行动的差距"，即在高压环境下将高级救援目标转换为低级群命令的错误倾向过程。

Abstract: Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently
challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications. While Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area
search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a
significant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine
collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an
error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a
low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,
this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed
framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and
multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It
then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,
hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This
closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,
providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual
monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR
task. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and
command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task
completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by
$7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive
workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the
potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm
collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: Future planetary exploration missions demand high-performance, fault-tolerant

This paper evaluates the deployment of GNC and LVS algorithms on
next-generation multi-core processors--HPSC, Snapdragon VOXL2, and AMD Xilinx
Versal--demonstrating up to 15x speedup for LVS image processing and over 250x
speedup for Guidance for Fuel-Optimal Large Divert (GFOLD) trajectory
optimization compared to legacy spaceflight hardware. To ensure computational
reliability, we present ARBITER (Asynchronous Redundant Behavior Inspection for
Trusted Execution and Recovery), a Multi-Core Voting (MV) mechanism that
performs real-time fault detection and correction across redundant cores.
ARBITER is validated in both static optimization tasks (GFOLD) and dynamic
closed-loop control (Attitude Control System). A fault injection study further
identifies the gradient computation stage in GFOLD as the most sensitive to
bit-level errors, motivating selective protection strategies and vector-based
output arbitration. This work establishes a scalable and energy-efficient

potential to unify diverse control tasks under a single, promptable generalist
policy. However, existing approaches are either exclusively deployed on
simulated humanoid characters, or specialized to specific tasks such as
tracking. We propose BFM-Zero, a framework that learns an effective shared
latent representation that embeds motions, goals, and rewards into a common
space, enabling a single policy to be prompted for multiple downstream tasks
without retraining. This well-structured latent space in BFM-Zero enables
versatile and robust whole-body skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid in the real
world, via diverse inference methods, including zero-shot motion tracking, goal
reaching, and reward optimization, and few-shot optimization-based adaptation.
Unlike prior on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks, BFM-Zero builds
upon recent advancements in unsupervised RL and Forward-Backward (FB) models,
which offer an objective-centric, explainable, and smooth latent representation
of whole-body motions. We further extend BFM-Zero with critical reward shaping,
domain randomization, and history-dependent asymmetric learning to bridge the
sim-to-real gap. Those key design choices are quantitatively ablated in
simulation. A first-of-its-kind model, BFM-Zero establishes a step toward
scalable, promptable behavioral foundation models for whole-body humanoid
control.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合路径-不确定性协同优化深度强化学习和轻量级停滞检测机制的混合框架，显著提升了主动SLAM的探索效率和路径质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动SLAM方法存在探索速度慢和路径次优的问题，需要一种能够同时优化路径距离和地图不确定性的解决方案。

Method: 采用路径-不确定性协同优化深度强化学习框架，通过双目标奖励函数平衡探索与利用；结合轻量级停滞检测机制，通过激光雷达静态异常检测和地图更新停滞检测减少冗余探索。

Result: 相比前沿方法和RRT方法，探索时间缩短65%，路径距离减少42%，在复杂环境中显著提升探索效率，同时保持可靠的地图完整性。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效解决了主动SLAM的探索效率和路径优化问题，消融研究证实协同机制加速训练收敛，物理机器人平台验证了算法从仿真到真实环境的成功迁移性。

Abstract: Existing Active SLAM methodologies face issues such as slow exploration speed
and suboptimal paths. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid
framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement
Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The
Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance
and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing
exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces
redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update
Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental
results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our
approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up
to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments
while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the
collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation
on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical
applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world
environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GraspView是一个仅使用RGB图像的机器人抓取系统，在杂乱环境中无需深度传感器即可实现精确操作，通过全局场景重建、主动感知策略和在线度量对齐模块，显著优于RGB-D和单视图RGB基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人抓取依赖RGB-D相机提供几何信息，但在透明或反光物体上会失效，且在近距离时性能下降。为了解决这些问题，作者开发了仅使用RGB图像的抓取系统。

Method: 集成三个关键组件：1) 全局感知场景重建，从单RGB视图提供局部一致的几何信息；2) 渲染评分主动感知策略，动态选择最佳视角揭示被遮挡区域；3) 在线度量对齐模块，校准VGGT预测与机器人运动学以确保物理尺度一致性。

Result: 在多样化桌面物体上的实验表明，GraspView显著优于RGB-D和单视图RGB基线方法，特别是在严重遮挡、近场感知和透明物体情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: GraspView作为RGB-D管道的实用且多功能替代方案，能够在非结构化真实世界环境中实现可靠的抓取。

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation, yet
remains highly challenging in cluttered environments where occlusion, poor
perception quality, and inconsistent 3D reconstructions often lead to unstable
or failed grasps. Conventional pipelines have widely relied on RGB-D cameras to
provide geometric information, which fail on transparent or glossy objects and
degrade at close range. We present GraspView, an RGB-only robotic grasping
pipeline that achieves accurate manipulation in cluttered environments without
depth sensors. Our framework integrates three key components: (i) global
perception scene reconstruction, which provides locally consistent, up-to-scale
geometry from a single RGB view and fuses multi-view projections into a
coherent global 3D scene; (ii) a render-and-score active perception strategy,
which dynamically selects next-best-views to reveal occluded regions; and (iii)
an online metric alignment module that calibrates VGGT predictions against
robot kinematics to ensure physical scale consistency. Building on these
tailor-designed modules, GraspView performs best-view global grasping, fusing
multi-view reconstructions and leveraging GraspNet for robust execution.
Experiments on diverse tabletop objects demonstrate that GraspView
significantly outperforms both RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially
under heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects. These
results highlight GraspView as a practical and versatile alternative to RGB-D
pipelines, enabling reliable grasping in unstructured real-world environments.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在机器人强化学习中通过条件化策略于动态参数估计（上下文）来改进模拟到真实环境的迁移性能，结果表明上下文感知策略在所有设置中都优于上下文无关基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中模拟到真实环境迁移的主要挑战，即由于环境动态差异导致在模拟中训练的策略在真实世界中泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 将上下文估计模块集成到基于域随机化的强化学习框架中，并系统比较最先进的监督策略，在标准控制基准和真实世界推动任务上进行评估。

Result: 上下文感知策略在所有设置中都优于上下文无关基线，尽管最佳监督策略取决于具体任务。

Conclusion: 通过条件化策略于动态参数估计可以显著改进模拟到真实环境的迁移性能，但需要根据任务选择适当的监督策略。

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL)
for robotics, as policies trained in simulation often fail to generalize to the
real world due to discrepancies in environment dynamics. Domain Randomization
(DR) mitigates this issue by exposing the policy to a wide range of randomized
dynamics during training, yet leading to a reduction in performance. While
standard approaches typically train policies agnostic to these variations, we
investigate whether sim-to-real transfer can be improved by conditioning the
policy on an estimate of the dynamics parameters -- referred to as context. To
this end, we integrate a context estimation module into a DR-based RL framework
and systematically compare SOTA supervision strategies. We evaluate the
resulting context-aware policies in both a canonical control benchmark and a
real-world pushing task using a Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that
context-aware policies outperform the context-agnostic baseline across all
settings, although the best supervision strategy depends on the task.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种具有可重构机翼和同轴异构双旋翼配置的尾座式垂直起降无人机，通过改进的无斜盘机构减少结构重量和振动，实现了全飞行包线的稳定飞行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尾座式VTOL无人机虽然重量轻，但在多旋翼模式下易受风扰，因为其暴露较大的前机身面积。为了解决这一问题，需要设计可重构机翼和更高效的推进系统。

Method: 采用可重构机翼设计（多旋翼模式下收起，固定翼模式下展开），设计同轴异构双旋翼配置以提高功率效率，使用改进的无斜盘机构控制俯仰和滚转，并通过添加挥舞铰链优化结构减少振动。

Result: 该设计显著降低了总功耗，减少了结构重量和复杂性，并在过渡飞行测试中验证了无人机在整个飞行包线内的稳定飞行性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的尾座式无人机设计通过可重构机翼、高效推进系统和改进的无斜盘机构，成功解决了风扰问题，实现了高效、稳定的全模式飞行。

Abstract: The tailsitter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAV is widely used due to
its lower dead weight, which eliminates the actuators and mechanisms for
tilting. However, the tailsitter UAV is susceptible to wind disturbances in
multi-rotor mode, as it exposes a large frontal fuselage area. To address this
issue, our tailsitter UAV features a reconfigurable wing design, allowing wings
to retract in multi-rotor mode and extend in fixed- wing mode. Considering
power efficiency, we design a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor configuration,
which significantly re- duces the total power consumption. To reduce structural
weight and simplify structural complexity, we employ a swashplateless mechanism
with an improved design to control pitch and roll in multi-rotor mode. We
optimize the structure of the swashplateless mechanism by adding flapping
hinges, which reduces vibration during cyclic acceleration and deceleration.
Finally, we perform comprehensive transition flight tests to validate stable
flight performance across the entire flight envelope of the tailsitter UAV.

Conclusion: MacroNav框架在未知环境自主导航中实现了上下文表示与导航效率的良好平衡，为高级决策提供了有效的空间理解支持。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unknown environments requires compact yet expressive
spatial understanding under partial observability to support high-level
decision making. Existing approaches struggle to balance rich contextual
representation with navigation efficiency. We present MacroNav, a
learning-based navigation framework featuring two key components: (1) a
lightweight context encoder trained via multi-task self-supervised learning to
capture multi-scale, navigation-centric spatial representations; and (2) a
reinforcement learning policy that seamlessly integrates these representations
with graph-based reasoning for efficient action selection. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the context encoder's efficient and robust
environmental understanding. Real-world deployments further validate MacroNav's
effectiveness, yielding significant gains over state-of-the-art navigation
methods in both Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL),
while maintaining low computational cost. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots that can learn new skills from demonstrations is
an important challenge of modern robotics. Existing solutions often apply
end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or
symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current
VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which
hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic
approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this
paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that
uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic
representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate
new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for
low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced
in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic
representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from
observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential
of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA
policies in long-horizon tasks.

TL;DR: Evo-1是一个轻量级视觉-语言-动作模型，通过新颖的跨调制扩散transformer和两阶段训练范式，在减少计算量和提高部署效率的同时保持强大性能，无需机器人数据预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型参数量大、依赖大规模机器人数据预训练，导致训练计算成本高、实时推理部署困难，且训练范式会降低视觉语言骨干的感知表示，导致过拟合和泛化能力差。

Conclusion: Evo-1证明了轻量级VLA模型的可行性，在减少计算和部署成本的同时保持强大性能，为高效VLA模型研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful framework that
unifies perception, language, and control, enabling robots to perform diverse
tasks through multimodal understanding. However, current VLA models typically
contain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data
pretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as
limited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training
paradigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language
backbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.
In this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces
computation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong
performance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native
multimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated
diffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together
forming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training
paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the
representations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,
surpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also
attains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations,
Evo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory
overhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model
weights to facilitate future research on lightweight and efficient VLA models.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统在罕见、模糊和分布外场景中的脆弱性问题，通过结合人类上下文推理能力来弥补自主系统的不足。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型从多模态线索(驾驶员动作和环境上下文)推断驾驶意图，在语义层面进行人类与自动驾驶的仲裁协调。

Result: 在模拟人类设置中实现完美召回率和高精度；人类调查显示92%的参与者同意仲裁结果；在Bench2Drive基准测试中显著降低碰撞率并提升整体性能。

Conclusion: 基于语义语言表示的仲裁是共享自动驾驶的关键设计原则，使系统能够进行常识推理并保持与人类意图的连续性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain brittle in rare, ambiguous, and
out-of-distribution scenarios, where human driver succeed through contextual
reasoning. Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such
failures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most
existing methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which
represent only geometric paths and therefore fail to preserve the underlying
driving intent. We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates
human input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our
method leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from
multi-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to
synthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous
control. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it
achieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject
survey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with
arbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive
benchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and
improvement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy. Arbitration at
the level of semantic, language-based representations emerges as a design
principle for shared autonomy, enabling systems to exercise common-sense
reasoning and maintain continuity with human intent.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies are advancing rapidly, but their direct
evaluation in the real world remains costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
reproduce, particularly for tasks involving deformable objects. Simulation
provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often
fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body
interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that
constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots,
objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian
Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation
tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing,
demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world
execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies.
Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with
high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation
of robotic manipulation policies. Website: https://real2sim-eval.github.io/

TL;DR: X-Diffusion是一个利用人类视频数据训练机器人扩散策略的框架，通过添加噪声来消除人类与机器人之间的执行差异，同时保留高层次任务指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视频数据丰富易得，但人类与机器人在动作执行上存在根本差异，直接使用会导致物理不可行的动作。需要一种方法既能利用人类数据，又避免学习不可行的动作。

Method: 首先训练分类器区分人类和机器人的噪声动作，然后在策略训练中只使用添加足够噪声后分类器无法区分的人类动作。机器人动作在低噪声水平下监督细粒度去噪，人类动作在高噪声水平下提供粗粒度指导。

Result: 实验表明，直接混合训练会降低策略性能，而X-Diffusion能持续提升性能。在五个操作任务中，X-Diffusion比最佳基线平均成功率高出16%。

Conclusion: X-Diffusion提供了一个原则性框架，能够最大化利用人类数据而不学习动态不可行的动作，有效解决了人类与机器人执行差异的问题。

Abstract: Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing
source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ
fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct
kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that
are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,
human demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and
interact with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion
process: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade
while high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a
principled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages
human data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first
trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or
robot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after
adding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.
Actions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low
noise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at
higher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under
execution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion
consistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves
a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website
is available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.

TL;DR: GentleHumanoid框架将阻抗控制集成到全身运动跟踪策略中，实现上半身柔顺性，通过统一的弹簧模型处理抵抗性接触和引导性接触，在仿真和真实机器人上验证了其能减少峰值接触力并保持任务成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人需要在以人为中心的环境中安全自然地物理交互，但现有强化学习策略强调刚性跟踪而抑制外力，现有阻抗控制方法局限于基座或末端控制，主要关注抵抗极端力而非实现柔顺性。

Method: 提出GentleHumanoid框架，核心是统一的基于弹簧的公式，同时建模抵抗性接触（按压表面时的恢复力）和引导性接触（从人类运动数据采样的推拉动作），确保肩、肘、腕的动力学一致性力，并通过任务可调力阈值保证安全。

Result: 在仿真和Unitree G1人形机器人上评估，包括轻柔拥抱、坐立辅助和安全物体操作等需要不同柔顺性水平的任务，相比基线方法，该策略能持续减少峰值接触力同时保持任务成功率，实现更平滑自然的交互。

Conclusion: 该研究向能够在现实环境中安全有效与人类协作并处理物体的人形机器人迈出了一步，证明了整合阻抗控制到全身运动跟踪策略的可行性。

Abstract: Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where
safe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent
reinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress
external forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically
restricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme
forces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a
framework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking
policy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based
formulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing
against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human
motion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across
the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse
interaction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable
force thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,
including gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object
manipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak
contact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more
natural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots
that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in
real-world environments.
