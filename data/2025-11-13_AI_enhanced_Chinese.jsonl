This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316SNAM\u80fd\u6e90\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5de5\u5382\u7ed3\u6784\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7OCR\u3001\u89c6\u89c9LLM\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ece\u5de5\u5382P&ID\u56fe\u7eb8\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5382\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u7b80\u5316MGM\u7528\u6237\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528OCR\u3001\u89c6\u89c9LLM\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406PDF\u683c\u5f0f\u7684P&ID\u56fe\u7eb8\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u65b0\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5382\u7ec4\u4ef6\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u523091%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u5728\u5de5\u5382\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\uff0c93%\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u88ab\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a80%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5de5\u5382\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8138\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5634\u5507\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u884d\u751f\u6307\u6807\u6765\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8138\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fee\u6539\u5634\u5507\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5634\u5507\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5634\u5507\u53d7\u5230\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5f71\u54cd\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u7531\u9a71\u52a8\u97f3\u9891\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1a\u9759\u97f3\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u5bf9\u548c\u5339\u914d\u7684\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5634\u5507\u540c\u6b65\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u97f3\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u5634\u5507\u540c\u6b65\u5206\u6570\u7b49\u884d\u751f\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u6790\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5634\u5507\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8eab\u4efd\u53c2\u8003\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8138\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur.

It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically.

Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

To address this, our work advances a current state-of-the-art graph sparsification algorithm, maximizing algebraic connectivity (MAC). MAC is a sparsification method that preserves estimation performance by maximizing the algebraic connectivity, a spectral graph property that is directly connected to the estimation error. Unfortunately, MAC remains computationally prohibitive for online use and requires users to manually pre-specify a connectivity-preserving edge set. Our contributions close these gaps along three complementary fronts: we develop a specialized solver for algebraic connectivity that yields an average 2x runtime speedup; we investigate advanced step size strategies for MAC's optimization procedure to enhance both convergence speed and solution quality; and we propose automatic schemes that guarantee graph connectivity without requiring manual specification of edges. Together, these contributions make MAC more scalable, reliable, and suitable for real-time estimation applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5MAC\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5e94\u7528\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u4e13\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u63d0\u53472\u500d\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u957f\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u5584\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7fMAC\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u957f\u671f\u56fe\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0cMAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4ee3\u6570\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u8fde\u901a\u8fb9\u96c6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u7528\u4ee3\u6570\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u83b7\u5f972\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u7814\u7a76MAC\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6b65\u957f\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u56fe\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u8fb9\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u4f7fMAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5f97\u5230\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u624b\u52a8\u914d\u7f6e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u66f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u56fe\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios.

Yet, humans often remain passive observers, fascinated but uncertain how to engage. Robots, in turn, cannot reach their full potential in human-populated environments without effectively modeling human states and intentions and adapting their behavior. To achieve a synergistic human-robot collaboration (HRC), a continuous information flow should be established: humans must intuitively communicate instructions, share expertise, and express needs. In parallel, robots must clearly convey their internal state and forthcoming actions to keep users informed, comfortable, and in control. This review identifies and connects key components enabling intuitive information exchange and skill transfer between humans and robots. We examine the full interaction pipeline: from the human-to-robot communication bridge translating multimodal inputs into robot-understandable representations, through adaptive planning and role allocation, to the control layer and feedback mechanisms to close the loop.

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684actor-critic\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9000\u5316\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u8b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0/\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e73\u8861\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u4e0e\u8bef\u62a5\u6291\u5236\u7684\u65f6\u673a\u51b3\u7b56\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u566a\u58f0\u6062\u590d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408actor-critic\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747\u4e8b\u6545\u524d\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5728Gaussian\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u65e9\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment.

These perception modules are vulnerable to epistemic uncertainty, often failing when encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) measurements not seen during training. To address this gap, we introduce ATOM-CBF (Adaptive-To-OoD-Measurement Control Barrier Function), a novel safe control framework that explicitly computes and adapts to the epistemic uncertainty from OoD measurements, without the need for ground-truth labels or information on distribution shifts. Our approach features two key components: (1) an OoD-aware adaptive perception error margin and (2) a safety filter that integrates this adaptive error margin, enabling the filter to adjust its conservatism in real-time.

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

This requires users to choose a time step, which is both critical and challenging: large steps can produce non-physical artifacts, while small steps force the simulation to run slowly. Continuous-time error-controlled integration avoids such issues by automatically adjusting the time step to achieve a desired accuracy. But existing error-controlled integrators struggle with the stiff dynamics of contact, and cannot meet the speed and scalability requirements of modern robotics workflows. We introduce CENIC, a new continuous-time integrator that brings together recent advances in convex time-stepping and error-controlled integration, inheriting benefits from both continuous integration and discrete time-stepping. CENIC runs at fast real-time rates comparable to discrete-time robotics simulators like MuJoCo, Drake and Isaac Sim, while also providing guarantees on accuracy and convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "CENIC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u51f8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\uff0c\u8fd9\u65e2\u5173\u952e\u53c8\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1a\u5927\u6b65\u957f\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u975e\u7269\u7406\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u800c\u5c0f\u6b65\u957f\u4f1a\u8feb\u4f7f\u6a21\u62df\u8fd0\u884c\u7f13\u6162\u3002\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u521a\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "CENIC\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u51f8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7ee7\u627f\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u3002", "result": "CENIC\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4e0eMuJoCo\u3001Drake\u548cIsaac Sim\u7b49\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5b9e\u65f6\u901f\u7387\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "CENIC\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition.

It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary.

In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization.

However, motion planning in real-time within unknown, changing environments remains a challenge for such robots due to the high dimensionality of the configuration space and the complex collision-avoidance constraints that must be obeyed. In this work, we propose a novel way to alleviate the curse of dimensionality by leveraging the structure imposed by shared joints (e.g. torso joints) in a dual-arm robot. First, we build two dynamic roadmaps (DRM) for each kinematic chain (i.e. left arm + torso, right arm + torso) with specific structure induced by the shared joints. Then, we show that we can leverage this structure to efficiently search through the composition of the two roadmaps and largely sidestep the curse of dimensionality.

Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a32x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4ee53-5\u500d\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5fc5\u987b\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u572832x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528IsoFlops\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u9ad8\u8fbe7e19 FLOPs\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u3001ImageNet\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff08Fr'echet\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u3002", "result": "1) \u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b2) \u968f\u7740\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u9700\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b3) \u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u6bcf\u5e74\u589e\u957f4-5\u500d\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u672a\u6765\u4e94\u5e74\u5185\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data.

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

This paper presents a novel shared control framework featuring planning-level intention prediction. A path replanning algorithm is designed to adjust the robot's desired trajectory according to inferred human intentions. To represent future motion intentions, we introduce the concept of an intention domain, which serves as a constraint for path replanning. The intention-domain prediction and path replanning problems are jointly formulated as a Markov Decision Process and solved through deep reinforcement learning. In addition, a Voronoi-based human trajectory generation algorithm is developed, allowing the model to be trained entirely in simulation without human participation or demonstration data. Extensive simulations and real-world user studies demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces operator workload and enhances safety, without compromising task efficiency compared with existing assistive teleoperation approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u7ea7\u610f\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5171\u4eab\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u57df\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u8fd0\u52a8\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u610f\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5171\u4eab\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65e0\u7f1d\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u76f8\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u610f\u56fe\u57df\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u672a\u6765\u8fd0\u52a8\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5c06\u610f\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eVoronoi\u56fe\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8377\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u8f85\u52a9\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5212\u7ea7\u610f\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8377\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Code and data available at https://github.com/alvco/Founding_Fathers_AI", "summary": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u5f0f(GIS)\u641c\u7d22\u6765\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bba\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4ecd\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3LLM\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u5f00\u56fd\u5143\u52cb\u89d2\u8272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f53\u4ee3\u653f\u6cbb\u8bae\u9898\u751f\u6210\u56de\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4ef2\u88c1\u5206\u6570\u4e3a88.3\u5bf971.7\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u5fae\u6027\u548c\u6218\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u662f\u901a\u8fc7GIS\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Existing zero-shot studies have shown that incorporating memory mechanisms to support goal-directed behavior can improve long-horizon planning performance. However, they overlook visual frontier boundaries, which fundamentally dictate future trajectories and observations, and fall short of inferring the relationship between partial visual observations and navigation goals. In this paper, we propose Semantic Cognition Over Potential-based Exploration (SCOPE), a zero-shot framework that explicitly leverages frontier information to drive potential-based exploration, enabling more informed and goal-relevant decisions. SCOPE estimates exploration potential with a Vision-Language Model and organizes it into a spatio-temporal potential graph, capturing boundary dynamics to support long-horizon planning. In addition, SCOPE incorporates a self-reconsideration mechanism that revisits and refines prior decisions, enhancing reliability and reducing overconfident errors. Experimental results on two diverse embodied navigation tasks show that SCOPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 4.6\\% in accuracy. Further analysis demonstrates that its core components lead to improved calibration, stronger generalization, and higher decision quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCOPE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f5c\u529b\u56fe\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53474.6%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8fb9\u754c\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u63a8\u65ad\u90e8\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCOPE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a2\u7d22\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f5c\u529b\u56fe\u6355\u6349\u8fb9\u754c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u6211\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u673a\u5236\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSCOPE\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u51fa4.6%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SCOPE\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input.

To unlock the full potential of VLMs in robotics, we shift their role from passive observers to active strategists in the navigation process. Our framework outsources high-level planning to a VLM, which leverages its contextual understanding to guide a frontier-based exploration agent. This intelligent guidance is achieved through a trio of techniques: structured chain-of-thought prompting that elicits logical, step-by-step reasoning; dynamic inclusion of the agent's recent action history to prevent getting stuck in loops; and a novel capability that enables the VLM to interpret top-down obstacle maps alongside first-person views, thereby enhancing spatial awareness.

We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81(SiPF)\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5377\u79ef(RIAttnConv)\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u53d7\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ffc\u5c16\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684RI\u7279\u5f81\u66ff\u4ee3\u539f\u59cb\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9650\u5236\u6e90\u4e8e\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u53d7\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ffc\u5c16\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81(SiPF)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u65cb\u8f6c\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u70b9(\u9634\u5f71)\uff0c\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8RI\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5377\u79ef(RIAttnConv)\u96c6\u6210SiPF\u5230\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eBingham\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9634\u5f71\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u90e8\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684RI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u65cb\u8f6c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709RI\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faArgus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u516c\u5171\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4f1a\u9762\u4e34\u5404\u79cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u5371\u9669\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u54cd\u5e94\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f39\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u6846\u67b6Argus\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7ADS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5f53EGO\u8f66\u8f86\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5371\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u5668\u65e0\u7f1d\u63a5\u7ba1\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "Argus\u4e0eTCP\u3001UniAD\u548cVAD\u4e09\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u7aef\u5230\u7aefADS\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5e73\u5747\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe150.30%\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u9ad8\u8fbe64.38%\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Argus\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002"}}

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5LyapInf\uff0c\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u72b6\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u6536\u655b\u5230\u671f\u671b\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u96be\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u6b21\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Zubov\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6b8b\u5dee\u6765\u62df\u5408\u672a\u77e5\u4e8c\u6b21\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u4e0e\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u692d\u7403\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "LyapInf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

While recent multi-agent approaches introduce cooperation, they often focus merely on perception-level tasks, overlooking the alignment with downstream planning and control, or fall short in leveraging the full capacity of the recent emerging end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present UniMM-V2X, a novel end-to-end multi-agent framework that enables hierarchical cooperation across perception, prediction, and planning. At the core of our framework is a multi-level fusion strategy that unifies perception and prediction cooperation, allowing agents to share queries and reason cooperatively for consistent and safe decision-making. To adapt to diverse downstream tasks and further enhance the quality of multi-level fusion, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to dynamically enhance the BEV representations. We further extend MoE into the decoder to better capture diverse motion patterns. Extensive experiments on the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a 39.7% improvement in perception accuracy, a 7.2% reduction in prediction error, and a 33.2% improvement in planning performance compared with UniV2X, showcasing the strength of our MoE-enhanced multi-level cooperative paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniMM-V2X\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u5f3aBEV\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728DAIR-V2X\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u611f\u77e5\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u9762\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c4\u5212\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7edf\u4e00\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u5f3aBEV\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06MoE\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728DAIR-V2X\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534739.7%\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e7.2%\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534733.2%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4UniV2X\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "MoE\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u534f\u4f5c\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Although traditional search methods have been extensively applied, metaheuristic algorithms have gained popularity due to their efficiency and problem-specific heuristics. However, challenges such as premature convergence and lack of solution diversity still hinder their performance in complex scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Enhanced Multi-Strategy Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (EDMO) algorithm, tailored for three-dimensional UAV trajectory planning in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments. EDMO integrates three novel strategies: (1) a Dynamic Quantum Tunneling Optimization Strategy (DQTOS) to enable particles to probabilistically escape local optima; (2) a Bio-phototactic Dynamic Focusing Search Strategy (BDFSS) inspired by microbial phototaxis for adaptive local refinement; and (3) an Orthogonal Lens Opposition-Based Learning (OLOBL) strategy to enhance global exploration through structured dimensional recombination. EDMO is benchmarked on 39 standard test functions from CEC2017 and CEC2020, outperforming 14 advanced algorithms in convergence speed, robustness, and optimization accuracy.

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\\%-6.4\\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\\%$ to $7\\%$.

Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \\emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget.

Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \\& Eosin (H\\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance.

This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs.

Despite the recent advancements in motion tracking, most existing methods demand extensive tuning and rely on reference data during deployment, limiting adaptability. We present APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient Exploration), a plug-and-play extension to state-of-the-art motion tracking algorithms that eliminates any dependence on reference data during deployment, improves sample efficiency, and reduces parameter tuning effort. APEX integrates expert demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL) by incorporating decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is combined with a multi-critic framework that balances task performance with motion style. Moreover, APEX enables a single policy to learn diverse motions and transfer reference-like styles across different terrains and velocities, while remaining robust to variations in reward design. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments in both simulation and on a Unitree Go2 robot. By leveraging demonstrations to guide exploration during RL training, without imposing explicit bias toward them, APEX enables legged robots to learn with greater stability, efficiency, and generalization. We believe this approach paves the way for guidance-driven RL to boost natural skill acquisition in a wide array of robotic tasks, from locomotion to manipulation.

To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification.

However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties.

We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like \"golf\" and \"basketball\".

We present a unified framework enabling independent torque and stiffness commands in real-time for diverse soft actuator types. Our unified force law captures diverse soft muscle physics in a single model with sub-ms computation, while our cascaded controller with analytical inverse dynamics maintains decoupling despite model errors and disturbances. Using co-contraction/bias coordinates, the controller independently modulates torque via bias and stiffness via co-contraction-replicating biological impedance strategies. Simulation-based validation through contact experiments demonstrates maintained independence: 200x faster settling on soft surfaces, 81% force reduction on rigid surfaces, and stable interaction vs 22-54% stability for fixed policies.

These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c42\u548c\u63ed\u793a\u5185\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684AI\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f93\u51fa\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u3002\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c42\u548cAI\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5c42\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5224\u65ad\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56e0\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches.

The two most critical attributes of a dataset are the amount of information it provides and how easily this information can be learned by models. However, the multimodal nature of embodied data makes evaluating these properties particularly challenging. Prior work has largely focused on diversity, typically counting tasks and scenes or evaluating isolated modalities, which fails to provide a comprehensive picture of dataset diversity. On the other hand, the learnability of datasets has received little attention and is usually assessed post-hoc through model training, an expensive, time-consuming process that also lacks interpretability, offering little guidance on how to improve a dataset. In this work, we address both challenges by introducing two principled, data-driven tools. First, we construct a unified multimodal representation for each data sample and, based on it, propose diversity entropy, a continuous measure that characterizes the amount of information contained in a dataset. Second, we introduce the first interpretable, data-driven algorithm to efficiently quantify dataset learnability without training, enabling researchers to assess a dataset's learnability immediately upon its release. We validate our algorithm on both simulated and real-world embodied datasets, demonstrating that it yields faithful, actionable insights that enable researchers to jointly improve diversity and learnability.

We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks.

Webb", "Geoffrey Mackellar"], "title": "EEG-X: Device-Agnostic and Noise-Robust Foundation Model for EEG", "comment": null, "summary": "Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions.

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch.

However, its performance degrades in degenerate environments, such as long corridors and high-altitude flights, where LiDAR measurements are imbalanced or sparse, leading to ill-posed state estimation. In this letter, we present LODESTAR, a novel LIO method that addresses these degeneracies through two key modules: degeneracy-aware adaptive Schmidt-Kalman filter (DA-ASKF) and degeneracy-aware data exploitation (DA-DE). DA-ASKF employs a sliding window to utilize past states and measurements as additional constraints. Specifically, it introduces degeneracy-aware sliding modes that adaptively classify states as active or fixed based on their degeneracy level. Using Schmidt-Kalman update, it partially optimizes active states while preserving fixed states. These fixed states influence the update of active states via their covariances, serving as reference anchors--akin to a lodestar. Additionally, DA-DE prunes less-informative measurements from active states and selectively exploits measurements from fixed states, based on their localizability contribution and the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. Consequently, DA-ASKF enables degeneracy-aware constrained optimization and mitigates measurement sparsity, while DA-DE addresses measurement imbalance. Experimental results show that LODESTAR outperforms existing LiDAR-based odometry methods and degeneracy-aware modules in terms of accuracy and robustness under various degenerate conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "LODESTAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe-\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65bd\u5bc6\u7279-\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u9000\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe-\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u5728\u9000\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u957f\u8d70\u5eca\u3001\u9ad8\u7a7a\u98de\u884c\uff09\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u5bfc\u81f4\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "1. \u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65bd\u5bc6\u7279-\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u5229\u7528\u8fc7\u53bb\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u989d\u5916\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u9000\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7c7b\u72b6\u6001\u4e3a\u6d3b\u8dc3\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\uff1b2. \u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\uff0c\u4fee\u526a\u6d3b\u8dc3\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5229\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLODESTAR\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "conclusion": "LODESTAR\u901a\u8fc7\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe-\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u5728\u9000\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

We propose a paradigm shift from \"model training\" to \"model raising\", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\"\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\"\u8f6c\u5411\"\u6a21\u578b\u57f9\u517b\"\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u521d\u671f\u5c31\u878d\u5165\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u5185\u5728\u878d\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u5efa\u7acb\u540e\u624d\u8fdb\u884c\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u5931\u51c6\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u4ef7\u503c\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5f00\u59cb\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6539\u53d8\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u4e3a\u751f\u6d3b\u4f53\u9a8c\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u642d\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u811a\u624b\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u671f\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u8bb0\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u627f\u8bfa\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\uff0c\u4f7f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5185\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5f00\u59cb\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u521d\u671f\u5c31\u878d\u5165\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\"\u6a21\u578b\u57f9\u517b\"\u8303\u5f0f\u5177\u6709\u5173\u952e\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

For humanoid robots, human videos and motion data are abundant and widely available, offering a free and large-scale data source. Besides, the semantics related to the motions enable modality alignment and high-level robot control learning. However, how to effectively mine raw video, extract robot-learnable representations, and leverage them for scalable learning remains an open problem. To address this, we introduce Humanoid-Union, a large-scale dataset generated through an autonomous pipeline, comprising over 260 hours of diverse, high-quality humanoid robot motion data with semantic annotations derived from human motion videos. The dataset can be further expanded via the same pipeline. Building on this data resource, we propose SCHUR, a scalable learning framework designed to explore the impact of large-scale data on high-level control in humanoid robots. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHUR achieves high robot motion generation quality and strong text-motion alignment under data and model scaling, with 37\\% reconstruction improvement under MPJPE and 25\\% alignment improvement under FID comparing with previous methods.

Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly.

We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $\u03a9$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $\u03a9$ drops. Computing $\u03a9$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice.

These two components enable efficient data generation that aligns with real egocentric observations and can be directly transferred across different robot embodiments without any post-processing.

Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins.

Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework.

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability.

We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models.

In contrast, abundant human motion data is readily available from motion capture, videos, and virtual reality, which could help address the data scarcity problem. However, due to the embodiment gap and missing dynamic information like force and torque, these demonstrations cannot be directly executed on robots. To bridge this gap, we propose Scalable Physics-Informed DExterous Retargeting (SPIDER), a physics-based retargeting framework to transform and augment kinematic-only human demonstrations to dynamically feasible robot trajectories at scale. Our key insight is that human demonstrations should provide global task structure and objective, while large-scale physics-based sampling with curriculum-style virtual contact guidance should refine trajectories to ensure dynamical feasibility and correct contact sequences. SPIDER scales across diverse 9 humanoid/dexterous hand embodiments and 6 datasets, improving success rates by 18% compared to standard sampling, while being 10X faster than reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, and enabling the generation of a 2.4M frames dynamic-feasible robot dataset for policy learning.

NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines.

However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAP-VLA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u6dfb\u52a0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u793a\u6784\u5efa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u4e14\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5373\u65f6\u611f\u5b98\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u793a\u6784\u5efa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5355\u5143\u6355\u83b7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5339\u914d\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMAP-VLA\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe7.0%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8625.0%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MAP-VLA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c6a\u65af\u591a\u592b\u7ef4\u6570(HD)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5FGM-HD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b(FGM)\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684HD\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u52a8\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u548cHD\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b(FGM)\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684HD\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u9884\u6d4bHD\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eHD\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5355\u8c03\u52a8\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff1b3) \u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528HD\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFGM-HD\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cbFGM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8639%\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06HD\u5f15\u5165FGM\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3aFGM\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use.

This architecture incorporates design innovations that enhance modality fusion and computational efficiency, while seamlessly enabling joint optimization with downstream objectives. Trained on billion-scale real-world transactions, TGPT significantly improves downstream classification performance against a competitive production model and exhibits advantages over baselines in generating future transactions. We conduct extensive empirical evaluations utilizing a diverse collection of company transaction datasets spanning multiple downstream tasks, thereby enabling a thorough assessment of TGPT's effectiveness and efficiency in comparison to established methodologies. Furthermore, we examine the incorporation of LLM-derived embeddings within TGPT and benchmark its performance against fine-tuned LLMs, demonstrating that TGPT achieves superior predictive accuracy as well as faster training and inference.

However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4f53\u73b0\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u4e3a\u8eab\u4f53\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e4b\u95f4\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b26\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u7269\u7406AI\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u8eab\u4f53\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u63cf\u8ff0\u7269\u7406\u4f53\u73b0\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff1a\u4f53\u73b0\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u7406\u6784\u6210\u5c01\u95ed\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u6301\u7eed\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u7ecf\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7269\u7406AI\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c06\u516d\u4e2a\u539f\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5c01\u95ed\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7269\u7406AI\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u4f53\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7269\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u4f53\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u62bd\u8c61\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency.

Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u79fb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u6784\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53d8\u5316(TAC)\u503c\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6700\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4f5c\u4e3aTAC\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7c7b\u522b\u5e76\u79fb\u9664\u540e\u95e8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e6\u53d1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53d8\u5316(TAC)\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u79fb\u9664\u540e\u95e8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8eTAC\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u6b63\u540e\u95e8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6700\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4f5c\u4e3aTAC\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684L2\u8303\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u79fb\u9664\u540e\u95e8\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001GTSRB\u548cTinyImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u6291\u5236\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6e05\u6d01\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u6784TAC\u503c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u79fb\u9664\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to \"identity mapping\", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid \"identity mapping\" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection.

Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy.

Main paper: 7 pages with 4 figures; Appendix: 8 pages with 7 figures", "summary": "Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences.

Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts.

Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u6216\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e14\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b(GLP)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e3b\u5e72\uff08\u652f\u6301\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u5b9a\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08\u91cd\u5efa\u611f\u77e5\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cPAN\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u957f\u671f\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "PAN\u671d\u7740\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u62df\u3002"}}

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations.

Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis.

In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL.

Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes.

Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods.

However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.\n  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments.

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \\textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728RLHF/DPO\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8f6c\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u867d\u7136RLHF/DPO\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u5df2\u6709\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u7ebf\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u5c0f\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u548c\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u653b\u51fb\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6b21\u6570\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6295\u6bd2\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76f8\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RLHF/DPO\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u8bca\u65ad\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bDermBench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cDermEval\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u57284500\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDermBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b4000\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3DermEval\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53d9\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6279\u5224\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u57284500\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDermBench\u548cDermEval\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.251\u548c0.117\uff08\u6ee1\u52065\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Mat\u00e9rn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u94fe\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u671f\u671b\u6781\u503c\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5e38\u7528\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u540e\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u8c03\u6574\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u671f\u671b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u94fe\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4f30\u8ba1\u671f\u671b\u6781\u503c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9bRBF\u548cMat\u00e9rn\u7b49\u5e38\u7528\u6838\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5206\u6790\u677e\u5f1b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u503c\u7d27\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u533a\u76f4\u5f84\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u6784\u9020\u66f4\u7d27\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation.

To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task.

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDFDT\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\u62fc\u63a5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee4\u724c\u63d0\u5347\u62fc\u63a5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6807\u51c6\u9009\u62e9\u6e90\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u62fc\u63a5\u6027\u5dee\uff1a\u72b6\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u9519\u4f4d\u3001RTG\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fde\u63a5\u5904\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdDT\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "DFDT\u901a\u8fc7MMD\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548cOT\u504f\u5dee\u4e24\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u878d\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u6e90\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee4\u724c\u66ff\u4ee3RTG\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528Q\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6291\u5236\u8fde\u63a5\u5904\u7684\u503c\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8df3\u8dc3\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u72b6\u6001\u503c\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e0eMMD\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548cOT\u504f\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ea6\u91cf\u7f29\u5c0f\u65f6\u8fb9\u754c\u6536\u7d27\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728D4RL\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDFDT\u5728\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DFDT\u901a\u8fc7\u6062\u590d\u62fc\u63a5\u6027\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality.

FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).", "AI": {"tldr": "FSampler\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e0e\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6267\u884c\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u53bb\u566a\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u5916\u63a8\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u66ff\u4ee3\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b08-22%\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8282\u7701\u548c15-25%\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c31\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "FSampler\u7ef4\u62a4\u6700\u8fd1\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u9636\u3001\u4e09\u9636\u6216\u56db\u9636\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5916\u63a8\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2aepsilon\u3002\u5728\u9009\u5b9a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684epsilon\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u5305\u542b\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728FLUX.1 dev\u3001Qwen Image\u548cWan 2.2\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cFSampler\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff08SSIM 0.95-0.99\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u65f6\u95f48-22%\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u752815-25%\u3002\u5728\u6fc0\u8fdb\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u53ef\u8fbe45-50%\uff08SSIM 0.73-0.74\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "FSampler\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity.

When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u751f\u5411\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u56fa\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5728\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53cd\u9988\u5f52\u56e0\u5668\uff08\u8bc6\u522b\u89e6\u53d1\u5b66\u751f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u63a5\u6536\u5668\uff08\u786e\u5b9a\u53cd\u9988\u5e94\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6559\u5e08\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u6b67\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u4e00\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u9519\u8bef\u518d\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as \"Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:\", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors.

PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "FQ-PETR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9PETR\u7cfb\u52173D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u53cc\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728W8A8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u4ec51%\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1175%\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u9ad8\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u91cf\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u53cb\u597d\u7684LiDAR\u5c04\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\uff08QFPE\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u5355\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u66ff\u4ee3\u591a\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2\uff09\u53cc\u67e5\u627e\u8868\uff08DULUT\uff09\u8fd1\u4f3c\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u540e\u91cf\u5316\uff08QANS\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5931\u771f\u3002", "result": "\u5728PETR\u3001StreamPETR\u3001PETRv2\u3001MV2d\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cW8A8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u4ec51%\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe75%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u548cQAT\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FQ-PETR\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Existing approaches generally follow an \"align-then-classify\" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\\texttt{$\\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\\textbf{F}$lexib$\\textbf{L}$e neighb$\\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\\% of the seen data.

To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters.

However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.", "AI": {"tldr": "OUGS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf93D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u8bed\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u5f80\u5f80\u53d7\u5230\u65e0\u5173\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u4ece3D\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u8bed\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e32\u67d3\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u4f20\u64ad\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863DGS\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "OUGS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u539f\u5219\u5316\u3001\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002"}}

Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55Feynman-Kac\uff08FK\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u81f3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u671d\u5411\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u80fd\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u5408\u5242\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u9884\u6d4b\u754c\u9762\u80fd\u91cf\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6837\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u7ed3\u679c\u671d\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u6216\u751f\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u6216\u5e8f\u5217\u7ec4\u6210\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06FK\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528ProteinMPNN\u548c\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u677e\u5f1b\u7cbe\u70bc\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u5408\u5242\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\uff0cFK\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u9884\u6d4b\u754c\u9762\u80fd\u91cf\u5b66\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\uff1b\u8bc1\u660eFK\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "FK\u63a7\u5236\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72D-3D\u914d\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0e\u672f\u524dCT\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u672f\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u547c\u5438\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5f02\u548cCT\u4e0e\u8eab\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u8ba1\u7b97\u771f\u5b9e\u5185\u7aa5\u955cRGB\u5e27\u4e0eCT\u6e32\u67d3\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee2.65\u6beb\u7c73\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee0.19\u5f27\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8fdb\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models.

Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u8d28ViT\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u540c\u8d28CNN\u6559\u5e08\u534f\u540c\u6307\u5bfc\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "ViT\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5f3a\u540c\u8d28CNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743 - \u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u5f02\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f - \u5b66\u751f\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728HMDB51\u3001EPIC-KITCHENS-100\u548cKinetics-400\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728HMDB51\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u83b7\u5f975.95%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u8d28\u548c\u540c\u8d28\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6307\u5bfc\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamPose3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e76\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2a3D\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u7cca\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece2D\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5173\u8282\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u878d\u5165\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u59ff\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728Human3.6M\u548cMPI-3DHP\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u5e7f\u64ad\u68d2\u7403\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u76842D\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamPose3D\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates.

We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MARBLE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u540c\u6b65Q\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eWhittle\u6307\u6570\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u5207\u6362\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRMAB\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u56fa\u5b9a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5305\u542b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MARBLE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u81c2\u6dfb\u52a0\u6f5c\u5728\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u63d0\u51faMarkov-Averaged Indexability\u51c6\u5219\u4f5c\u4e3a\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u540c\u6b65Q\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eWhittle\u6307\u6570\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728MAI\u51c6\u5219\u4e0b\uff0cQWI\u7b97\u6cd5\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u7136\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6700\u4f18Q\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684Whittle\u6307\u6570\uff1b\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "MARBLE\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684RMAB\u95ee\u9898\uff0cQWI\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution.

In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport.

Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.\n  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.\n  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.\n  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "WOODELF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684SHAP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u80cc\u666fSHAP\u503c\uff0c\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21SHAP\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "WOODELF\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4f2a\u5e03\u5c14\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6574\u4e2a\u80cc\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u80cc\u666fSHAP\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b300\u4e07\u884c\u3001500\u4e07\u80cc\u666f\u6837\u672c\u548c127\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cWOODELF\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u6709\u80cc\u666fShapley\u503c\u4ec5\u9700162\u79d2\uff0cGPU\u4e0a\u4ec5\u970016\u79d2\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8616\u500d\u548c165\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "WOODELF\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97SHAP\u503c\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Python\u5305\u5f62\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6613\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u5ddeHarbor Freeway\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aANFIS-GP\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cBi-LSTM\u5728\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5feb\u901f\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\uff0c\u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u5835\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf(ITS)\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3aITS\u6838\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u63aa\u65bd\u5982\u531d\u9053\u8ba1\u91cf\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u4ea4\u901a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u5ddeHarbor Freeway\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u572820\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\uff08\u6700\u957f1\u5c0f\u65f640\u5206\u949f\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u91c7\u7528RMSE\u3001MAE\u548cR-Square\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6570\u53d8\u6362\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "result": "ANFIS-GP\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u7a97\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08RMSE 0.038\uff0cMAE 0.0276\uff0cR-Square 0.9983\uff09\uff0cBi-LSTM\u5728\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff08RMSE 0.1863\uff0cMAE 0.0833\uff0cR-Square 0.987\uff09\u3002Bi-LSTM\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5e73\u5766\u7684\u659c\u7387\uff08RMSE 0.0454\uff0cMAE 0.0545\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6700\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u786e\u5b9a\u4e3a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples.

However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation.

However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPTE\uff08Probing then Editing\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u4fdd\u7559\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b-\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u65f6\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u5b64\u5c9b\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "PTE\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b-\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u63a2\u6d4b\u5f85\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u90bb\u57df\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u9884\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u6267\u884c\u63a8-\u62c9\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u63a8\u5206\u652f\u4f7f\u7528\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\u4e3b\u52a8\u62c6\u89e3\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u62c9\u5206\u652f\u5e94\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u539f\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPTE\u5728CWRU\u548cSCUT-FD\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "PTE\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f85\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness.

However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684SEP\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u7406\u6210\u56e0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u548cad-hoc\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728341\u4e2aSEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec244\u4e2a\u663e\u8457\u8d28\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u8981SEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684SEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86SEP\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u592a\u9633\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Freeman"], "title": "Latent Planning via Embedding Arithmetic: A Contrastive Approach to Strategic Reasoning", "comment": null, "summary": "Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions.

Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios.

Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks.

Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class.

The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenePheno\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u56e0\u6572\u9664\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u8868\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9057\u4f20\u4fe1\u606f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u8868\u578b\u662f\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u56e0\u53d8\u4f53\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u8868\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6574\u7406\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u6355\u6349\u8868\u578b\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6392\u4ed6\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u56e0\u529f\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGenePheno\u5728\u57fa\u56e0\u4e2d\u5fc3Fmax\u548c\u8868\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3AUC\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u57fa\u56e0\u529f\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "GenePheno\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8868\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
